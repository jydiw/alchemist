Over the years it \\nhas been gratifying to be told by so many people how much they regretted not \\nseeing a fourth edition. It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to present \\nthis new edition, especially with the new perspective of having been away from \\nit for almost twenty years. \\n\\nUnlike many subsequent textbook editions, we have made a number of sig-\\nnificant changes. Perhaps the most significant of these is that we are using the \\n“atoms first” approach, which has made such inroads into the general chemistry \\ncurriculum since the third edition. After an introductory chapter on “Chemis-\\ntry and the Scientific Method,” we go on to discuss elements, compounds, and \\nchemical nomenclature along with a brief introduction to atoms, molecules, \\nand the nuclear model of the atom. In Chapter 3 we emphasize the periodic \\nproperties of the elements by way of a few selected chemical reactions of the \\nvarious groups of elements. Having introduced the periodic table, probably the \\nmost important topic in general chemistry, we then have six chapters where we \\nuse the quantum theory to present the underlying explanation of the periodic \\nproperties of the elements. The first of these six chapters, Chapter 4, discusses \\natomic spectra and the concept of the quantization of energy levels. Then in \\nChapter 5 we discuss multielectron atoms and show the connection between \\nthe electron configurations of multielectron atoms and chemical periodicity. \\nChapter 6 discusses ionic bonds, the simplest type of bonding. After a rather \\nthorough discussion of Lewis formulas in Chapter 7, we go on to use Lewis \\nformulas to predict molecular geometries using VSEPR theory in Chapter 8. \\nThis introduces the students to a great variety of molecules and compounds \\nand gives more practice writing Lewis formulas. In Chapter 9, the last of the six \\nconsecutive chapters on quantum theory and atomic and molecular structure, \\nwe present a fairly detailed introduction to covalent bonding, using simple mo-\\nlecular orbital theory for diatomic molecules and hybrid orbitals to describe the \\nbonding in polyatomic molecules.\\n\\nFinally, in Chapter 10, we embark on a fairly conventional sequence of \\nchapters on chemical reactivity, chemical calculations, the properties of gases, \\nthermochemistry, liquids and solids, solutions, chemical kinetics, chemical \\nequilibria, acids and bases, thermodynamics, oxidation-reduction reactions, \\nelectrochemistry, and transition metals.\\n\\nWe have noticed that many general chemistry texts do not make a clear \\ndistinction between a chemical reaction, which is an actual physical process \\nthat takes place in the laboratory, and the chemical equation that we use to \\nexpress this reaction. How we choose to write a chemical equation to describe \\na chemical reaction is somewhat arbitrary in the sense that the balancing (stoi-\\nchiometric) coefficients are arbitrary. We can write an equation with one set of \\nbalancing coefficients or any multiple of them. Thus we can express the reac-\\ntion of hydrogen and oxygen as \\n\\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l)\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACExvi\\n\\nor as\\n\\nH2(g) + \\n1_\\n2 \\nO2(g) → H2O(l)\\n\\nif we want to emphasize the combustion of one mole of hydrogen. Thus, for \\nexample, the value of the enthalpy of combustion of the reaction is –237.1 kilo- \\njoules per mole in the first case and –118.5 kilojoules per mole in the second \\ncase, where mole refers to a mole of the reaction as described by the equation as \\nwritten. This also strongly points out that the balancing coefficients are relative \\nquantities and consequently are unitless. Both of these statements are in accord \\nwith just about every physical chemistry book and should be adhered to.\\n\\nAnother important feature, one that we used in previous editions but was \\nnot always appreciated, is that equilibrium constants as we define them in the \\nintroductory chapters on equilibria have units. There is no way to get around \\nthis. They are looking right at you when you define an equilibrium constant in \\nterms of concentrations, Kc, or pressures, Kp. You can appeal to some sort of \\nstandard state of unit concentration or unit pressure to make the units mys-\\nteriously disappear, but certainly such an arbitrary convention is not justified \\nat this point. Furthermore, when doing equilibrium calculations, the result-\\ning equilibrium concentrations should come out in terms of concentration or \\npressure, which they don’t if Kc or Kp are taken to be unitless. The reason for \\nsuppressing the units in equilibrium constants is the anticipation of using the \\nthermodynamic equation\\n\\n∆G°rxn = –RT  ln K\\n\\nClearly K cannot have units in order to take its logarithm. It is important to \\nrealize in this case that K is not the same as Kc or Kp. It is the thermodynamic equi-\\nlibrium constant that is defined by \\n\\nK = Kc/Q°c        or        K = Kp/Q ºp\\n\\nwhere Q°c is the standard reaction quotient which has a numerical value of unity \\nwith units of molarity and Q°p is the similar quantity for pressure. Now, and only \\nnow, is K unitless. A formal introduction of the concept of the thermodynamic \\nequilibrium constant is not just another way of saying the same thing as in the \\nearlier chapters, but is an entirely new equilibrium constant. All this is in accord \\nwith the 1982 recommendation of the International Union of Pure and Applied \\nChemistry (IUPAC). \\n\\nWe have usually adhered to the IUPAC recommendations, but could not \\nbring ourselves to do it in the case of pressure units. IUPAC recommends the \\nuse of the SI units of bars and Pascals, but atmospheres are so ingrained in the \\nchemistry curriculum that it is difficult to not use them. Consequently we use \\nboth bars and atmospheres throughout the text and require the students to be \\nbilingual in this regard. Along the same lines, we have eschewed the use of the \\nterm STP, which is woefully ambiguous. The IUPAC definition of STP is the \\nconditions at one bar and 0ºC, whereas the older, fully ingrained definition still \\npermeating chemistry texts is the conditions at one atmosphere and 0ºC. An in-\\nformal survey of many high school chemistry teachers shows that the venerable \\nfact that one mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.414 liters at one atmosphere and \\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE xvii\\n\\n0ºC is still in great use, whereas under the IUPAC recommendations one mole \\nof an ideal gas occupies 22.711 liters at one bar and 0ºC.\\n\\nOne final innovation is the use of what we call Interchapters for the  \\nintroduction of descriptive chemistry. These Interchapters are available at  \\nwww.McQuarrieGeneralChemistry.com. Every general chemistry author knows \\nall too well that how to present descriptive chemistry is a nagging problem, as \\nnumerous articles over the years in the Journal of Chemical Education attest. In \\nthe third edition, for example, we included two full chapters on “The Chemistry \\nof the Main Group Elements.” Unfortunately, many instructors simply do not \\nhave the time, or perhaps even the inclination, to cover these chapters because \\nthese chapters typically come toward the end of the text. We have elected to \\npresent descriptive chemistry in a number of short online segments (about ten \\npages) that can be covered readily or assigned as reading; references to relevant \\ninterchapters are given throughout the book. For example, some of the inter-\\nchapters are called “Hydrogen and Oxygen,” “The Alkali Metals,” “Nitrogen,” \\n“Saturated Hydrocarbons,” “Unsaturated Hydrocarbons,” “Aromatic Hydrocar-\\nbons,” “The Main-Group Metals,” and so on. It seems particularly worthwhile \\nthat the students be introduced to an elementary discussion of organic chemistry \\nat an early stage so that organic molecules can be used as examples. Although \\nwe have avoided references to the plethora of websites out there because of \\ntheir volatility, we do strongly recommend the Journal of Chemical Education web-\\nsite called Periodic Table Live!, which you can link to at www.McQuarrie \\nGeneralChemistry.com. When you click on an element in the periodic table in \\nthis website, you get a list of its chemical and physical properties and even pho-\\ntos and videos of a number of its reactions. Students should be encouraged to \\nrefer to this website frequently.\\n        Donald A. McQuarrie\\n\\t \\t \\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nxix\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\nWhen Don McQuarrie, Peter Rock, and I agreed to collaborate on this fourth \\nedition of their classic chemistry text, we shared a common vision of what the \\nnew text should offer.\\n\\nWe decided to begin with atomic theory and then to discuss chemical bond-\\ning and molecules before introducing reaction classes and other chemical prop-\\nerties. Because chemical reaction classes and chemical properties flow naturally \\nfrom chemical bonding and structure, we believed this sequence would lead stu-\\ndents to a more comprehensive understanding of these complex topics. For ex-\\nample, we use Lewis formulas to show why acetic acid is acidic, sodium hydrox-\\nide is basic, and methanol is neutral, despite all three having what appear to be \\nhydroxyl (OH) groups. Such a presentation is nearly impossible if reactions are \\ntaught before structure, but follows naturally from an “atoms first” approach.\\n\\nAnother important change from earlier editions was in reformatting the \\nchapter frontispieces in the form of profiles of prominent scientists in the style \\nof Don’s other books. We hope these brief biographies of great pioneers in  \\nthe sciences will serve as role models to inspire students considering careers  \\nin the field, and that these will prove interesting and valuable to instructors and \\nstudents alike.\\n\\nWe also wanted to integrate many concepts from organic, polymer, bio-\\nlogical, and descriptive chemistry as supplements to the main chapters. The \\nsecond edition had inserted this material as short “interchapters” interspersed \\nthroughout the text. In this edition we bring back, and expand upon, the inter-\\nchapters but make them available via the Internet and cross-reference them in \\nthe printed version. This enables the instructor to pick and choose among them \\nand permits us to include additional interchapters as the need arises. We also \\nhope that others will submit short interchapters for general chemistry that we \\ncan collect on our website for public distribution. Moreover, making these sup-\\nplements available electronically, rather than incorporating them in the text, \\nreduces the physical size and the cost of the text to students. \\n\\nIn developing this edition we worked closely with Sapling Learning to pro-\\nvide an optional electronic homework system to accompany the text. This pro-\\nvides students with instantaneous feedback on assignments so that students can \\nimprove their understanding of the chemical principles of each chapter. This \\nsystem will improve the use of class time and includes short practice exercises to \\naid in the mastery of concepts.\\n\\nAdditionally, there are a number of other innovations in this edition, such \\nas the use of IUPAC conventions throughout, careful attention to significant \\nfigures in all problems and illustrative examples, and utilization of the CRC \\nHandbook of Chemistry and Physics as the source of most data. \\n\\nFor readers familiar with earlier editions, the current version divides both \\nthe chapter on quantum theory and that on kinetics into two chapters each to \\nallow for more examples and applications. For instance, we now include a sec-\\ntion on enzyme kinetics. We also changed how we present nuclear chemistry \\nin this edition. Rather than including a chapter that focuses mostly on nuclear \\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACExx\\n\\nphysics, we chose instead to add a new interchapter on the chemical applica-\\ntions of radioisotopes, while integrating the material on first-order nuclear de-\\ncay and radio-dating into the chapters on kinetics. Finally, we added several \\nnew interchapters on current topics of interest, such as “The World Supply of \\nEnergy.”\\n\\nLittle could I have imagined when I began work on this text that both of \\nthe original authors would pass away during the course of this project. We lost \\nPeter shortly after commencing this revision. Fortunately, Don survived to see \\nthe book’s manuscript through to completion. I am most grateful to Carole \\nMcQuarrie, Don’s wife and a chemist in her own right, whose help was as invalu-\\nable as Don’s, and who carried on heroically collaborating on the work after his \\npassing.\\n\\nWorking with Don on this project has expanded my professional growth \\nand knowledge more than any other endeavor I have previously undertaken. I \\nhave no way to repay the wisdom and experience that he so generously shared \\nwith me during the course of our collaboration. I only hope that this book, the \\nfruit of our efforts, will be of as much benefit to the students who use it as it has \\nbeen to me in helping to create it. \\n\\nThis book could not have been completed without the assistance of a great \\nmany people and institutions. First and foremost, I wish to thank Don McQuar-\\nrie and Peter Rock, whose brilliance as scientists and chemical educators live on \\nwithin these pages.\\n\\nI would also like to thank our publisher, Bruce Armbruster of University \\nScience Books, who made this fourth edition possible; my department and col-\\nleagues at Santa Monica College, who provided me with time to work on this as \\nwell as valued pedagogical advice; Mervin Hanson, for his herculean effort in \\nreworking all the problem solutions and for his invaluable suggestions with the \\ntext; Nate Lewis, for his contributions to the Energy interchapter; Miriam Ben-\\nnet, Lisa Dysleski, Harry B. Gray, Hal Harris, Mark L. Kearley, Joseph Kushick, \\nRobert Lamoreaux, Jacob Morris, and Alan Van Orden, who all helped contrib-\\nute to this work; George Kelvin and Laurel Muller, for their excellent artwork \\nthroughout; Wang Zhaozheng, for the cover art; Jane Ellis, for her hours of help \\nin securing photos and rights and her efforts in marketing; Jennifer Uhlich and \\nthe staff of Wilsted & Taylor Publishing Services for their excellent layout. I also \\nwish to thank Kate Liba, who first taught me the art of writing, and William M. \\nJackson, my Ph.D. advisor at the University of California, Davis, from whom I \\nlearned the art of research. I also thank my family for their patience and for-\\nbearance during the years in which I labored on this text. \\n\\nThis edition is dedicated to the memory of Don McQuarrie and Peter Rock.\\n\\n       Ethan B.

He obtained \\na Bachelor of Law degree from the University of Paris, but despite his father’s wishes for him to pursue a career in law,  \\nhe chose to follow one in science. He was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences at the early age of 27.  \\nIn 1771, he married Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze (1758–1836), the daughter of a parliamentary lawyer and financier. \\nSoon after their marriage, she learned chemistry on her own in order to assist her husband in his work and became \\nmore than just an assistant. She was fluent in several languages and was able to translate chemical publications in other \\nlanguages into French, so that they were current in the research being carried out in other countries. She also studied \\npainting with the well-known artist, Jacques Louis David, who painted the portrait of the couple shown above. Her \\nexacting attention to detail in her illustrations of the equipment used, especially in his famous book, Elementary Treatise \\non Chemistry, allowed their results to be reproduced and verified. Using the most sensitive balances available, Lavoisier \\nshowed that the masses of the reactants and the products of a chemical reaction are the same, and thereby discovered \\nthe law of conservation of mass, which was to place chemistry on a firm quantitative basis. He also was the first to show \\nthat combustion is a reaction with oxygen, and later confirmed that water was not an element but rather was composed \\nof hydrogen and oxygen. Because of his financial connection with a much hated tax-collecting firm, Lavoisier was \\ndenounced, arrested, and guillotined in 1794 by supporters of the French Revolution. Jean-Paul Marat, a key figure in \\nthe Revolution, had developed a hatred of him because Lavoisier had shown Marat to be a poor chemist and denied his \\nadmission to the French Academy of Sciences. In spite of being impoverished after his death, Lavoisier’s wife saw that \\nall of their manuscripts were published and distributed. Lavoisier is generally considered to be the father of modern \\nchemistry, but more accurately the Lavoisiers together should be regarded as the parents of modern chemistry because  \\nof Marie-Anne Lavoisier’s invaluable collaboration in their achievements.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n1.

Most of you do not plan to \\nbecome professional chemists; probably only about one in a hundred of you \\nwill graduate with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry. Whatever your chosen field \\nof study, however, there is a good chance that you will need a knowledge of  \\nelementary chemistry.\\n\\nChemists use the scientific method to describe the immense variety of \\nthe world’s substances, from a grain of sand to the components of the human \\nbody. As you will see, they can do this because chemistry is a quantitative sci-\\nence, based on experimental measurements and scientific calculations. You \\nmust therefore begin with a clear understanding of the methods scientists \\nuse to measure and calculate physical quantities. This chapter gives you these  \\nfoundations.\\n\\n1-1. Why Should You Study Chemistry?\\nChemistry is the study of the properties of substances and how they react with \\none another. Chemical substances and chemical reactions pervade all aspects \\nof the world around us. The new substances formed in reactions have prop-\\nerties different from those of the substances that reacted with one another, \\nproperties that chemists can predict and put to use. Hundreds of materials that  \\nwe use every day, directly and indirectly, are products of chemical research (Fig-\\nure 1.1).\\n\\nThe examples of useful products of chemical reactions are limitless. The de-\\nvelopment of fertilizers, one of the major focuses of the chemical industry, has \\nprofoundly affected agricultural production. Equally important is the pharma-\\nceutical industry. Who among us has not taken an antibiotic to cure an infection \\nor used a drug to alleviate the pain associated with dental work, an accident, or \\nsurgery? Modern medicine, which rests firmly upon chemistry, has increased \\nour life expectancy by about 18 years since the 1920s. It is hard to believe that, \\nlittle over a century ago, many people died from simple infections.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. CHEMISTRY AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD2\\n\\nPerhaps the chemical products most familiar to us are plastics. About 50% \\nof industrial chemists are involved with the development and production of \\nplastics. The United States alone produces over 50 million metric tons (110 bil-\\nlion pounds) of plastics a year, some 5 billion kilograms (11 billion pounds) of \\nwhich are synthetic fibers used in bed sheets, clothing, backpacks, shoes, and \\nother woven materials. This corresponds to about 160 kg (350 lb) of plastics and \\n16 kg (35 lb) of synthetic fibers per person living in the United States per year. \\nNames such as nylon, polyethylene, Formica, Saran, Teflon, Hollofil, Gore-Tex, \\npolyester, Nalgene, PVC, and silicone are familiar to us in our homes, our cloth-\\ning, and the activities of our daily life. Chemistry also underlies the products \\nthat make our daily life possible—computer chips, paper, fuels, cement, liquid \\ncrystal displays, detergents, magnetic storage media, refrigerants, batteries, \\nscents, flavorings, preservatives, paint, ceramics, solar cells, and cosmetics, to \\nname only a few. In addition, metals such as steel, lightweight alloys of titanium \\nand aluminum, and materials made from carbon fibers make possible modern \\nships, automobiles, aircraft, and satellites.\\n\\nChemistry is also needed for a study and understanding of our environ-\\nment. Unfortunately, a great many people today have a fear of chemicals, owing \\nin part to the legacy of various pesticides such as DDT, chemical contamination \\nof waterways, and air pollution. However, an understanding of these problems \\nand their solutions also comes from the study of the chemistry involved. Bio-\\ndegradable packing materials, hydrogen fuel cells, recyclable carpeting, and  \\nnon-ozone-depleting refrigerants are just some of the new environmentally \\nfriendly “green” substances being developed by today’s chemists.\\n\\nIt is remarkable that all chemicals are built up from only about 100 different \\nbasic units, called atoms. Atomic theory pictures substances as atoms, or groups \\nof atoms, joined together into units called molecules and ions. You will start by \\nexploring atomic theory, then go on to study chemical bonding and chemical \\nreactions, and then learn to do calculations involving chemical reactions. You \\nwill learn to make predictions about what reactions take place, under what con-\\nditions they take place, and how quickly they take place; what substances are \\n\\nFigure 1.1 A modern chemical research \\nlaboratory.\\n\\n\\n\\nproduced in these reactions; and what the structure, properties, and behavior \\nof these substances will be. You will learn the chemistry behind many of the \\nmaterials and processes we have already mentioned. We are confident that you \\nwill find your study of chemistry both interesting and enjoyable.\\n\\n1-2. Chemistry Is an Experimental Science\\nChemistry is an experimental science based on the scientific method. The es-\\nsence of the scientific method is the use of carefully controlled experiments to \\nanswer scientific questions (Figure 1.2).\\n\\nTo use the scientific method, we must first define our goal; that is, we must \\nfirst formulate the question we wish to answer. After defining our goal, our next \\nstep is to collect information or data about the subject under consideration. \\nThe data we collect will be of two sorts: qualitative data, consisting of descrip-\\ntive observations, and quantitative data, consisting of numbers obtained by \\nmeasurement. If we gather enough data about our subject, we will be able to \\nform a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a proposition put forth as the possible expla-\\nnation for, or prediction of, an observation or a phenomenon. If hypotheses are \\nsupported by a sufficient number of experimental observations obtained under \\na wide variety of conditions, they evolve into scientific theories.\\n\\nTo test a hypothesis, we perform experiments. If the experiments support \\nthe hypothesis, then we perform further experiments to see whether our results \\nare reproducible under a variety of experimental conditions. After many ex-\\nperiments, a pattern may emerge in the form of a constant relationship among \\nphenomena under the same conditions. A concise statement of this relationship \\nis called a law of nature or a scientific law. A law summarizes the relationship \\nbut does not explain it.\\n\\nFigure 1.2 Chemistry is based firmly on \\nthe results of experiments. Carefully \\nplanned experiments are an endless \\nsource of fascination, excitement, and \\nchallenge.\\n\\n1-2. CHEMISTRY IS AN ExPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 3\\n\\n\\n\\n1. CHEMISTRY AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD4\\n\\nOnce a law has been formulated, scientists try to develop a theory, or a uni-\\nfying principle, that explains the law based on the experimental observations. \\nEventually, the theory also will be tested and perhaps modified or rejected as \\na result of further experimentation. Theories are ever evolving as new experi-\\nments are carried out. The scientific method underlies chemistry. When we \\nstudy atomic theory in Chapter 2, we will see how the results of a large body of \\nexperiments led to the discovery of several important laws, which were in turn \\nexplained by a unifying atomic theory of matter.\\n\\nIt is important to realize that no theory can ever be proved correct by ex-\\nperiment. Experimental results can provide supporting data for a theory, but \\nno matter how many experiments yield results consistent with a theory, the pos-\\nsibility always remains that additional experiments will demonstrate a flaw in \\nthe theory. This is the primary reason why experiments should be designed to \\ndisprove a hypothesis or theory rather than simply to provide additional sup-\\nport for the theory. The role of experiments, hypotheses, laws, and theories in \\nthe scientific method is outlined in Figure 1.3.\\n\\nAs Figure 1.3 shows, scientific theories are subject to ongoing revision. For \\nexample, the theory that the sun goes around the earth was replaced by one \\nin which the earth orbits the sun, and later by one in which each orbits their \\ncombined center of mass. Still later this theory was replaced by one involving \\nboth space and time, as proposed by Albert Einstein. Most theories in use have \\nknown limitations. An imperfect theory is often useful, however, even though \\nwe cannot have complete confidence in its theoretical predictions. For example, \\na theory that correctly predicts the result, say, 90% of the time is quite useful. \\nBecause scientific theories produce a unification of ideas, imperfect theories \\ngenerally are not abandoned until a better theory is developed.\\n\\nGoal or question\\n\\nQualitative and\\nquantitative data\\n\\nHypothesis\\n\\nExperiments\\n\\nResults inconsistent\\nwith hypothesis\\n\\nRevise hypothesis Law\\n\\nTheory modified as\\nnecessary by\\n\\nfurther experiments \\n\\nTheory\\n\\nResults consistent\\nwith hypothesis \\n\\nx\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n03/27/09\\n\\n001-003\\n\\nFigure 1.3 The interactive role of \\nexperiments, hypotheses, laws, and \\ntheories in the scientific method.\\n\\n\\n\\n1-3.  Modern Chemistry Is Based on Quantitative Measurements\\n\\nAlthough early peoples around the world practiced various forms of rudimen-\\ntary chemistry and made many important technological discoveries (Figure 1.4), \\nchemistry didn’t begin to develop as a modern science until the eighteenth cen-\\ntury. Modern physical sciences are based firmly on quantitative measurements, \\nmeasurements in which the result is expressed as a number. For example, the \\ndeterminations that the mass of 1.00 cubic centimeter (cm3) of gold is 19.3 \\ngrams and that 1.25 grams of calcium react with 1.00 gram of sulfur express \\nthe results of quantitative measurements. Compare these determinations with \\nqualitative observations, where we note general characteristics, such as color, \\nodor, taste, and the tendency to undergo chemical change in the presence of \\nother substances. An example of a qualitative statement is that lead is much \\ndenser than aluminum. As we shall see later in this chapter, the corresponding \\nquantitative statement is that the mass of 1.00 cm3 of lead is 11.3 grams, whereas \\nthe mass of 1.00 cm3 of aluminum is 2.70 grams.\\n\\nThe French scientist Antoine Lavoisier (Frontispiece) was the first chemist \\nto fully appreciate the importance of carrying out quantitative chemical mea-\\nsurements in the modern sense. Lavoisier designed special balances that were \\nmore accurate than any devised before, and he used these balances to discover \\nthe law of conservation of mass: in a chemical reaction, the total mass of the \\nreacting substances is equal to the total mass of the products formed. In other \\nwords, by careful quantitative measurements Lavoisier was able to show that \\nmass is conserved in chemical reactions.

Chemeia probably \\nderives from the word Khem, the name \\nfor ancient Egypt, in honor of their \\ntechniques in metalworking and early \\ntheories of transmutation. However, \\nsome scholars believe that chemeia is of \\nChinese origin, derived from the words \\nkim mi in southern dialect, meaning \\n“the secret of gold.”\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n1. CHEMISTRY AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD6\\n\\nment of chemistry as a modern science cannot be overstated. In 1789 he pub-\\nlished his Elementary Treatise on Chemistry, in which he presented a unified pic-\\nture of the chemical knowledge of the time. The Elementary Treatise on Chemistry \\n(Figure 1.5) was translated into many languages and was the first textbook of \\nchemistry based on quantitative experiments.\\n\\nThroughout this text we use scientific notation to represent many numbers. \\nScientific notation is the expression of a number as multiplied by a power of \\n10. For example, a large number such as 6 000 000 may be expressed as 6 × 106, \\nbecause 106 = 1 000 000 and\\n\\n6 × 106 = 6 × 1 000 000 = 6 000 000\\n\\nSimilarly, the number 1.626 × 10–9 is equivalent to\\n\\n1.626 × 10–9 = 1.626 × 0.000 000 001 = 0.000 000 001 626\\n\\nIt is more convenient to express numbers such as these in terms of powers of 10 \\nrather than in decimal form.\\n\\nTo be successful in your study of chemistry, you should be proficient in the \\nuse and mathematical manipulation of numbers in scientific notation. A more \\ndetailed review of working with numbers in scientific notation is given in Ap-\\npendix A.\\n\\nExAMPLE 1-1: Express the numbers (a) 24 000 and (b) 0.000 000 572 \\nusing scientific notation.\\n\\nSolution: (a) The number 24 000 has four powers of 10 following the first \\ndigit:\\n\\n24 000\\n\\nThus, the number may be expressed as\\n\\n2.4 × 10 000 = 2.4 × 104\\n\\nin scientific notation.\\n\\n(b) Counting backwards from the 5 in the number 0.000 000 572, we see \\nthat there are seven powers of 10 between the 5 and the decimal place.\\n\\n0.000 000 572\\n\\nBecause the decimal place is to the left of the 5, this number is expressed in \\nscientific notation as 5.72 × 10–7.\\n\\nPRACTICE PROBLEM 1-1: Perform the addition: 2.26 × 10–5 + 1.7201 × 10–3. \\nState your answer in scientific notation.\\n\\nAnswer: 1.7427 × 10–3\\n\\n\\ue05c\\ue05c\\ue05c\\ue05c\\n 1   2   3  4\\n\\nFigure 1.5 The title page to Lavoisier’s \\ntextbook of chemistry.\\n\\n\\ue07c\\ue07c\\ue07c  \\ue07c\\ue07c\\ue07c \\ue07c\\n 7  6  5   4  3  2  1\\n\\nIt is good practice always to include \\na zero before a leading decimal point \\nso that the decimal point does not get \\noverlooked. For example, you should \\nwrite 0.345 instead of just .345. You \\ncan see here that the zero nicely alerts \\nyou to the presence of the following \\ndecimal point.\\n\\n\\n\\n1-4.  The Metric System of Units and Standards Is Used  \\nin Scientific Work\\n\\nWith every number that represents a measurement, the units of that measure-\\nment must be indicated. If we measure the thickness of a wire and find it to be \\n1.35 millimeters (mm), then we express the result as 1.35 mm. To say that the \\nthickness of the wire is 1.35 would be meaningless.\\n\\nThe preferred system of units used in scientific work is the metric system. \\nSeveral sets of units make up the metric system, but nowadays we express all \\nmeasurements in terms of just one set of metric units called SI units (for Sys-\\ntème International). Some basic SI units are given in Table 1.1.\\n\\nThe basic SI unit of length is the meter (m). Prior to the advent of SI units, \\nthe meter was defined as the length of a special platinum rod maintained in a \\nrepository in France. However, this standard for the meter is not precise enough \\nfor modern scientific work of the highest accuracy, primarily because of the \\nvariation in the length of the “meter rod” with temperature. The SI definition \\nof the meter is now given in terms of the speed of light in a vacuum (see Appen-\\ndix B), a fundamental constant of nature that is neither dependent on tempera-\\nture nor subject to mechanical damage or loss, as is a platinum rod. In more \\nfamiliar terms, a meter is equivalent to 1.094 yards, or to 39.37 inches. Thus, \\na meter stick is 3.37 inches (about 10%) longer than a yardstick (36 inches) \\n(Figure 1.6).\\n\\n1-4.

CHEMISTRY AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD8\\n\\nThe SI system of units uses a series of prefixes to indicate factors-of-10 mul-\\ntiples and fractions of SI units. For example, 1000 meters is called a kilometer\\n(km), which is equivalent to 0.621 miles and is the unit used to express distances \\nbetween towns and cities on maps and road signs in most countries throughout \\nthe world (Figure 1.7). A centimeter (cm) is one one-hundredth of a meter—\\nthere are 2.54 cm in one inch. Common SI-unit prefixes used in chemistry are \\ngiven in Table 1.2 (a more complete list is given in Appendix B). Some of these \\nprefixes, kilo- (kilogram and kilometer), centi- (centimeter), milli- (milliliter \\nand millimeter), mega- (megabytes and megatons), and giga- (gigabytes), are \\nin everyday use. We shall see later that the two prefixes pico- and atto- are com-\\nmonly used to describe molecular sizes and molecular energies.Figure 1.7 Road sign showing distances \\n\\nin miles and kilometers.\\n\\nPrefix Symbol Multiple Example*\\n\\ngiga- G 109 or 1 000 000 000 1 gigajoule, 1 GJ = 1 × 109 joules\\n\\n mega- M 106 or 1 000 000 1 megajoule 1 MJ = 1 × 106 joules\\n\\n kilo- k 103 or 1000 1 kilometer, 1 km = 1 × 103 meters\\n\\n centi- c 10–2 or 1/100 1 centimeter, 1 cm = 1 × 10–2 meters\\n\\n milli- m 10–3 or 1/1000 1 milliliter, 1 mL = 1 × 10–3 liters\\n\\n micro- \\ue06d 10–6 or 1/1 000 000 1 microsecond, 1 \\ue06ds = 1 × 10–6 seconds\\n\\n nano- n 10–9 or 1/1 000 000 000 1 nanometer, 1 nm = 1 × 10–9 meters\\n\\n pico- p 10–12 or 1/1 000 000 000 000 1 picometer, 1 pm = 1 × 10–12 meters\\n\\n femto- f 10−15 or 1/1 000 000 000 000 000 1 femtosecond, 1fs = 1 × 10−15 seconds\\n\\n atto- a 10–18 or 1/1 000 000 000 000 000 000 1 attojoule, 1 aJ = 1 × 10–18 joules\\n\\nTABLE 1.2 Common prefixes for SI units\\n\\n*We define liters and joules later in this chapter.\\n\\nExAMPLE 1-2: Using the prefixes given in Table 1.2, explain what is \\nmeant by (a) a microsecond; (b) a milligram; and (c) 100 picometers.\\n\\nSolution: (a) Table 1.2 shows that the prefix micro- means 10–6, so a \\nmicrosecond (\\ue06ds) is 10–6 seconds or one one-millionth (1/1 000 000) \\nof one second. Events that take place in microseconds are common in \\nscientific experiments. (b) The prefix milli- means 10–3, so a milligram \\nis 10–3 grams or one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a gram. (c) The prefix \\npico- means 10–12, so a picometer is 10–12 meters or one-millionth of \\none-millionth of a meter (10–12 is equal to 10–6 × 10–6 and 10–6 is one \\none-millionth). Thus, 100 picometers, or 100 pm, is equal to 100 × 10–12 \\nmeters or 1.00 × 10–10 meters. We shall see that the picometer is a conve-\\nnient unit of length when discussing the sizes of atoms and molecules.\\n\\nPRACTICE PROBLEM 1-2: What is meant by (a) 400 nm and (b) 20 ps?\\n\\nAnswer: (a) 4.00 × 10–7 m; (b) 2.0 × 10–11 s\\n\\n\\n\\nMeasures of volume, denoted by the symbol V, are derived from the basic SI \\nunit for length, which is the meter. A cubic meter (1 m3) is the volume of a cube \\nthat is one meter on each edge. However, a more convenient measure of volume \\nfor laboratory work is the liter. A liter is equal to the volume of a cube that is 10 \\ncentimeters (or one-tenth of a meter) on each edge (Figure 1.8). The volume of \\na cube is equal to the cube of the length of an edge of the cube; thus,\\n\\n1 L = (10 cm)3 = 1000 cm3\\n\\nA milliliter, 1 mL, is one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a liter; in other words, \\nthere are 1000 mL in one liter. Because 1000 mL and 1000 cm3 are both equal \\nto one liter, we conclude that 1 mL = 1 cm3; that is, a milliliter (1 mL) and a \\ncubic centimeter (1 cm3, sometimes also abbreviated “cc”) are equal to each \\nother. One liter is equal to 1.057 liquid U.S. quarts (see the inside of the back \\ncover); thus, the volume of a liter is 5.7% larger than the volume of a quart \\n(Figure 1.6). A U.S. gallon contains exactly 4 U.S. quarts and corresponds to \\n3.785 liters.\\n\\nThe SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). The mass of a cylinder of a plati-\\nnum-iridium alloy kept by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in \\nSèvres, France (near Paris), represents the standard kilogram, which is the only \\nbasic SI unit still defined by an artifact. One kilogram is equal to 1000 grams \\n(1 kg = 1000 g).\\n\\nThe mass of an object is determined in the laboratory by balancing its weight \\nagainst the weight of a reference set of masses (Figure 1.9). The mass values of \\nthe set of reference masses are fixed by comparison with the standard kilogram.\\n\\nBecause a mass is determined by balancing its weight against reference \\nmasses, the terms mass and weight are often used interchangeably (for example, \\n“the sample weighs 28 grams”). However, strictly speaking, these terms are not \\nthe same. The mass of an object characterizes the object’s inertia, or resistance \\nto being moved, and is an intrinsic property of the object. The weight of an \\nobject is equal to the force of attraction of the object to a large body, such as \\nthe earth or the moon. An object on the moon weighs about one-sixth as much \\nas it does on the earth, but the mass of the object is the same in both places. \\nTo avoid such ambiguities, we generally use the term mass rather than the term \\nweight throughout this book. A 1-kilogram mass weighs 2.205 pounds on earth; \\ntherefore, one pound is equivalent to 453.6 grams (Figure 1.6).\\n\\nA modern analytical balance (Figure 1.9, top) has the standard masses en-\\nclosed by the balance housing. The masses are controlled by an internal set of \\nmovable levers. The basic principle of operation is the same as that for the beam \\nbalance (Figure 1.9, middle), except that the balance point is detected optically \\nwith a light beam rather than visually with the naked eye. An electronic or digital \\nbalance (Figure 1.9, bottom) uses a pressure-sensitive crystal to measure mass. \\nThe electronic balances found in most general chemistry labs are precise to only \\nabout ±1 mg. For more sensitive measurements an analytical balance must be used.\\n\\nTemperature is a property that constitutes a quantitative measure of the \\nrelative tendency of heat to escape from an object. The higher the tempera-\\nture of an object, the greater is the tendency of heat to escape from the object. \\nWhen we say that water is “hot” to the touch, we mean that heat flows readily \\nfrom the water to our fingers, which are at a lower temperature than the water. \\nWhen the water is “cold,” the flow of heat is from our fingers to the water, which \\nis at a lower temperature than our fingers.

THE METRIC SYSTEM OF UNITS AND STANDARDS 9\\n\\n\\n\\n1. CHEMISTRY AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD10\\n\\nestablished by assigning temperatures to two reference systems. For example, a \\ntemperature scale can be established by assigning a temperature of exactly zero \\ndegrees to the freezing point of water and exactly 100 degrees to the boiling \\npoint of water at one atmosphere of pressure, the pressure of air at sea level on \\na clear day. We shall study pressure in more detail in Chapter 13.\\n\\nA thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. A thermome-\\nter contains a substance whose properties change in a reproducible way with \\nchanges in temperature. For example, the property might be the volume of a \\ncertain liquid, such as mercury. Because the volume of an enclosed sample of \\nmercury increases with increasing temperature, it can be used to measure tem-\\nperature. For instance, using the temperature scale proposed above, we mark \\non the glass rod the position of the mercury column when the thermometer is \\nin contact with an ice-water mixture; we label this position 0.0. Then we mark \\nthe position of the mercury column as 100.0, when the thermometer is in con-\\ntact with boiling water at one atmosphere of pressure. The temperature scale \\nis then determined by marking off the thermometer scale linearly between the \\ntwo calibration points.\\n\\nWe discuss temperature in more detail in Chapter 13. It is sufficient for our \\npurposes at this stage to know that there are three different (but interrelated) \\ntemperature scales in common use (Figure 1.10): the Celsius temperature scale, \\nthe Fahrenheit temperature scale, and the Kelvin temperature scale.\\n\\nThe most fundamental temperature scale is the Kelvin temperature scale, \\nand it defines the SI unit for temperature, which is called the kelvin (K). The \\nlowest possible temperature of the Kelvin scale is zero kelvin (0 K), which we \\nshall learn later is the lowest temperature that any substance can have. Note \\nthat the degree sign is omitted, and all temperatures on the Kelvin scale are \\npositive. The Celsius temperature scale (°C, denoted by t and once called the \\ncentigrade temperature scale) is related to the Kelvin temperature scale (de-\\nnoted by T) by the equation\\n\\nT (in K) = t (in ºC) + 273.15 (1.1)\\n\\nThus, a Kelvin temperature of 373.15 K corresponds to 373.15 – 273.15 = \\n100.00ºC (see Figure 1.10). One degree on the Celsius temperature scale corre-\\nsponds to the same temperature interval as one degree on the Kelvin tempera-\\nture scale. The two scales differ only in their zero points.\\n\\nThe United States is one of the very few countries in the world to use the \\nFahrenheit temperature scale (°F). On the Fahrenheit temperature scale, the \\ntemperature of an ice-water mixture is set as 32ºF and that of boiling water at \\none atmosphere of pressure is set at 212ºF. The Celsius temperature scale is \\nrelated to the Fahrenheit temperature scale by the equation\\n\\nt (in ºC) = (5/9) [t (in ºF) – 32.0] (1.2)\\n\\nNote that t (in ºC) = 0ºC when t (in ºF) = 32ºF and that t (in ºC) = 100ºC \\nwhen t (in ºF) = 212ºF. Using Equation 1.2, we see that a Fahrenheit temper-\\nature of 98.6ºF (“normal” body temperature) corresponds to a Celsius tem- \\nperature of\\n\\nt = (5/9) (98.6 – 32.0)ºC = 37.0ºC\\n\\nand a Kelvin temperature of\\n\\nT = (273.15 + 37.0) K = 310.2 K\\n\\nFigure 1.9 (top) An automatic analytical \\nbalance, (middle) a laboratory beam \\nbalance, and (bottom) an electronic \\nbalance; are all used to determine \\nmass. The beam balance requires the \\nplacement of standard masses on one \\nof the pans to achieve a mass balance.\\n\\n\\n\\nExAMPLE 1-3: Derive Equation 1.2 by considering the information in \\nFigure 1.10.\\n\\nSolution: We first note that there are exactly 100ºC between the boiling and \\nfreezing points of water on the Celsius scale. Comparison with the Fahren-\\nheit scale shows that there are 212ºF – 32ºF = 180ºF between the same two \\npoints on the Fahrenheit scale. Thus, a degree Fahrenheit is five-ninths \\n(100ºC/180ºF = 5ºC/9ºF) of a degree Celsius. We also note the 0ºC corre-\\nsponds to 32ºF; thus, there is a (5/9) × 32-degree shift in the zero point on \\ngoing from the Fahrenheit to the Celsius scale. Combination of these two \\nresults yields\\n\\nt (in ºC) = (5/9) t (in ºF) – (5/9) (32.0 ºF)\\n\\nor\\nt (in ºC) = (5/9) [t (in ºF) – 32.0]\\n\\nPRACTICE PROBLEM 1-3: (a) Convert –90ºF to degrees Celsius and to \\nkelvin. (b) Find the one value of the temperature at which the tempera-\\ntures on the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales coincide numerically.\\n\\nAnswer: (a) –68ºC, 205 K; (b) –40ºC = –40ºF\\n\\nDensity is an example of a property expressed in compound units because it \\ninvolves both the unit of mass and the unit of volume. Density is defined as the \\nmass per unit volume of a substance, density = mass/volume, or in symbols\\n\\n d = \\n m  (1.3)\\n V\\n\\nTo find the density of a material, we simply determine the volume of a known \\nmass of the material and then use Equation 1.3.\\n\\nThe concept of density allows us to compare the masses of equal volumes of \\nmaterials. The old joke that asks, “Which is heavier, a pound of lead or a pound \\nof feathers?” plays upon our intuition regarding density. Often, when we say \\nthat a material is heavy or light, we really mean that its density is high or low, \\nrespectively.\\n\\nEquation 1.3 indicates that the dimensions of density are mass per unit \\nvolume, which can be expressed in a variety of units. If we express the mass in \\ngrams and the volume in cubic centimeters, then the units of density are grams \\nper cubic centimeter. For example, the density of ice is 0.92 g/cm3, where the \\nslash denotes “per.” In other words, 0.92 grams of ice occupies a volume of 1 cm3 \\n(the “unit volume” in this case).\\n\\nFrom algebra, we know that 1 / an = a–n, where n is an exponent. Thus, \\n1 / cm3 = cm–3. Therefore, we also can express density as g·cm–3 instead of \\ng/cm3. The use of centered dots in compound units is an SI convention (Ap-\\npendix B) and is used to avoid ambiguities. For example, m·s denotes meter-\\nsecond, whereas ms (without the dot) denotes millisecond.\\n\\nWe also often use a subscript to represent a variable at a specific time or \\n\\n1-4.

Similarly, the subscript f is often used to represent \\nthe final state of a system. Throughout this text we define new symbols as we \\nencounter them.\\n\\nExAMPLE 1-4: Calculate the density of gold, given that, at 20ºC, 5.00 cm3 \\nof gold has a mass of 96.5 grams.\\n\\nSolution: Using Equation 1.3, we find that\\n\\nd =  m \\n \\n=\\n\\n     96.5 g     =\\n \\n19.3\\n\\n \\ng·cm–3\\n\\nV        5.00 cm3\\n\\nAs always, answers must be given with the accompanying units, in \\nthis case g·cm–3. An answer, “the density is equal to 19.3” has no meaning \\nbecause it is unclear whether the measurement refers to 19.3 g·cm–3, \\n19.3 g·L–1, 19.3 lb·ft–3 or some other combination of units expressing \\ndensity.\\n\\nPRACTICE PROBLEM 1-4: Mercury is the only metal that is a liquid at \\n25ºC. Given that 1.667 mL of mercury has a mass of 22.55 grams at 25ºC, \\ncalculate the density of mercury in units of g·mL–1 and g·cm–3.\\n\\nAnswer: 13.53 g·mL–1 = 13.53 g·cm–3\\n\\nThe density of a substance depends on the temperature. Because the vol-\\nume of a given mass of most substances increases as its temperature increases, \\nthe density of most substances decreases as the temperature increases. For ex-\\nample, because a 10.0-gram sample of mercury occupies a volume of 0.735 mL \\nat 0ºC and 0.749 mL at 100ºC, the densities of mercury at these two tempera-\\ntures are\\n\\nd =\\n       10.0 g       =\\n\\n \\n13.6\\n\\n \\ng·mL–1     (0ºC)\\n\\n    0.735 mL\\n\\nand\\n\\n  d =\\n      10.0 g       =\\n\\n \\n13.4\\n\\n \\ng·mL–1     (100ºC)\\n\\n  0.749 mL\\n\\nBoth density and temperature are examples of the intensive properties of \\na substance, which are properties whose values are independent of the amount \\nof a substance. For example, the density of gold at 20ºC is 19.3 g·cm–3, whether \\nthe gold sample consists of 5.00 g or 5.00 kg. In contrast to intensive properties, \\nextensive properties are directly proportional to the amount of a substance. \\nThus, mass and volume are both extensive properties. If we double the amount \\nof a substance, then the mass and the volume also double, but the density re-\\nmains the same (at a given temperature).\\n\\n\\n\\n1-5. The SI Unit of Energy Is a Joule\\nUp to this point we have introduced the SI or metric units for length, volume, \\nmass, and temperature. Energy plays a central role in chemistry, so in this sec-\\ntion we shall present a brief introduction to the concept of energy along with \\nits units.\\n\\nEnergy can be defined as the ability to cause a change in a physical system \\nsuch as the compression of a cylinder, the increase in temperature of a sub-\\nstance, or the movement of a mass. At this point it is useful to introduce two \\nforms of energy: the energy associated with a moving object, called kinetic en-\\nergy; and the energy of an object due to its location relative to a specific refer-\\nence point, called potential energy.\\n\\nThe kinetic energy of an object is defined as\\n\\nEk = \\n1_\\n2mv\\n\\n2 (1.4)\\n\\nwhere Ek is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the object, and v is its velocity. In \\nSI units, mass is given in kilograms and velocity in meters per second, yielding \\nkg·m2·s–2 as the units of energy. The SI unit of energy is the joule ( J), where \\n1 J = 1 kg·m2·s–2 (see Appendix B). Joules are named for James Prescott Joule \\n(Chapter 14 Frontispiece) whose research led to the law of conservation of en-\\nergy, which we discuss below. One joule is approximately the energy needed to \\nlift a 100-gram mass (about the mass of an orange) to a height of one meter. \\nTable 1.3 lists some other examples for you to get a better idea of the magnitude \\n\\n1-5.

For example, a 142-gram baseball at a height \\nof 30 meters has an energy relative to the ground because it will speed up if \\ndropped. For an object located above the ground, the potential energy, which \\nwe shall denote by Ep, is directly proportional to the mass, m, and to the height, \\nh, of the mass above the ground. Thus, we have\\n\\n Ep = mgh (1.5)\\n\\nwhere g is a proportionality constant, called the gravitational acceleration con-\\nstant, whose value is determined experimentally to be 9.81 m·s–2 on earth. If a \\nbaseball (0.142 kg) is 15 meters above the ground, then we calculate its poten-\\ntial energy using Equation 1.5 to be\\n\\nEp = mgh = (0.142 kg)(9.81 m·s–2)(15 m) \\n= 21 kg·m2·s–2 = 21 J\\n\\nOne of the most fundamental laws of science is the law of conservation of \\nenergy: during any process, energy is neither created nor destroyed. Energy \\ncan be converted from one form to another or transferred from one system to \\nanother, but the total amount of energy never changes.\\n\\nThe law of conservation of energy says that the sum of the kinetic energy \\nand potential energy of an object in flight is a constant. That is,\\n\\nEtotal = Ek + Ep = constant\\n\\nTherefore, an object moving upwards will decelerate as kinetic energy is changed \\ninto potential energy. An object at the apex of its upward trajectory will have \\nonly potential energy and no kinetic energy. As the object falls back down, it \\nexchanges its potential energy for kinetic energy, reaching its maximum energy \\nof motion just before hitting the ground (Figure 1.11).\\n\\nEn\\ner\\n\\ngy\\n/J\\n\\n60\\n\\n40\\n\\n20\\n\\n0\\n0 2 4 6\\n\\nKinetic\\nenergy\\n\\nPotential\\nenergy\\n\\nt/s\\n\\nFigure 1.11 The kinetic energy and \\npotential energy of an object in flight.\\n\\n\\n\\nExAMPLE 1-6: Calculate the maximum height that a bullet of mass \\n25 grams will reach if it is shot straight up with an initial speed (v0) of \\n450 m·s–1.

The SI unit \\nof power is a watt (W), which is defined as exactly one joule per second; that is, \\n1 W = 1 J·s–1. For example, a 40-watt incandescent light bulb emits energy in the \\nform of light (20%) and heat (80%) at a rate of 40 J·s–1.

Percentage Error Can Be Used to Measure Accuracy\\nThe counting of objects is the only type of experiment that can be carried out \\nwith complete accuracy, that is, without any inherent error. Let’s consider the \\nproblem of determining how many coins there are in a jar. We can determine \\nthe exact number of coins simply by counting them. Now suppose that there \\nare 1542 coins in the jar. The number 1542 is exact; there is no uncertainty as-\\nsociated with it. It is a different matter, however, when we wish to determine the \\nmass of 1542 coins with a balance (Figure 1.9). Suppose that the balance we use \\nis capable of measuring the mass of an object to the nearest one-tenth of a gram \\nand that we use it to determine the mass of the 1542 coins as 4776.2 ± 0.1 grams. \\nBecause our balance was capable of measuring only to the nearest one-tenth of \\na gram, we know that the 0.2 in 4776.2 is not an exact number. It could actually \\nbe any number between 0.1 and 0.3; for example, the mass could be 4776.13, \\n4776.262, or any number between 4776.1 and 4776.3. The ±0.1 indicates the \\nuncertainty in the last digit in the result 4776.2 grams.\\n\\nNow suppose we had a more sensitive balance capable of measuring the mass \\nof the coins to the nearest hundredth of a gram. Our result might be 4776.23 ± \\n0.01 grams, meaning any number in the range 4776.22 grams to 4776.24 grams. \\nWe would need a still more sensitive balance to determine the mass of the coins \\nto the nearest milligram (±0.001 g). Thus, unlike with counting, we can never \\ndetermine with absolute certainty what the mass of our 1542 coins is.\\n\\nIn scientific work we need to distinguish between the accuracy of a result \\nand the precision of a result. Accuracy refers to how close our result is to the \\nactual value. To clarify the distinction between precision and accuracy, let’s \\nreturn to our measurement of the mass of the 1542 coins. The result 4776.2 ± \\n0.1 grams for the mass of the coins may differ significantly from the actual mass \\nbecause perhaps the balance was improperly calibrated, or we misread the re-\\nsult displayed by the balance, or we failed to put all 1542 coins back in the jar, \\nor we forgot to correct for the mass of the jar.\\n\\nThe precision of a result conveys both how well repeated measurements of \\na quantity give results that agree with one another and how sensitive a measur-\\ning instrument was used (Figure 1.13). But high precision is no guarantee of \\nhigh accuracy, because the same error source may be present in each and every \\nmeasurement. The difference between accuracy and precision in experimental \\ndata is illustrated in Figure 1.14.\\n\\nOne measure of the accuracy of an experiment is the percentage error. \\nPercentage error is defined as the difference between the average value of the \\n\\n1-6.

The data collected \\nby group 1 are both accurate and \\nprecise. The data collected by group \\n2 are accurate because the average \\nof the five data points is close to the \\ntrue value; however, these data are less \\nprecise than those collected by group 1, \\nbecause the data points are much more \\nscattered about the true value.

(b) Using \\na reference source such as the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (avail-\\nable at most libraries) or an online source, look up the density of copper \\nat 20ºC and determine the percentage error in the average experimental \\ndensity.\\n\\nSolution: (a) The density is given by Equation 1.3 as the mass divided by \\nthe volume for the block. Thus, the density for each of the three trials is as \\nfollows:\\n\\nTrial 1 d =  \\n    5.051 g      = 8.85 g·cm–3\\n 0.571 cm3\\n\\nTrial 2 d =  \\n    5.052 g      = 8.76 g·cm–3\\n 0.577 cm3\\n\\nTrial 3 d =  \\n    5.055 g      = 8.79 g·cm–3\\n 0.575 cm3\\n\\nThe average of these results is simply the sum of the densities divided by \\nthe number of trials (3), so that\\n\\naverage density =  \\n (8.85 + 8.76 + 8.79) g·cm–3    = 8.80 g·cm–3 \\n\\n3\\n\\n(b) The true value for the density of copper metal is given in the CRC Hand-\\nbook of Chemistry and Physics as 8.96 g·cm–3 at 20ºC.

The Precision of a Measured Quantity Is Indicated by  \\nthe Number of Significant Figures\\n\\nIt is important in reporting scientific data to give both the value and the un-\\ncertainty (or precision) of the value. For example, if we walked into a pub and \\nobserved a darts player hit the bull’s-eye of a target, we would have no informa-\\ntion as to whether it was a “lucky shot” or the player was an international darts \\nchampion or somewhere in between. Only after observing a series of throws \\ncould we determine how good a darts player she is. For this same reason, experi-\\nmental results are generally not considered valid without a number of repeated \\ntrials and a stated experimental precision or uncertainty.\\n\\nDenoting the uncertainty of a measured quantity by the ± notation is de-\\nsirable in describing scientific results, but such a notation can often be cum-\\nbersome. In this text we indicate the precision of measured quantities by the  \\nnumber of significant figures used to express a result.\\n\\nAll digits in a numerical result are significant if only the last digit has some \\nuncertainty. A result expressed as 4776.2 grams means that there is an uncer-\\ntainty of at least one unit in the last digit and that there are five significant fig-\\nures in the result. Zeros are considered to be significant figures if they are not \\nincluded just to locate the decimal point; thus, both zeros in 1001.2 are signifi-\\ncant figures. Zeros are not considered to be significant figures if their presence \\nserves only to position the decimal point, as in 0.001 25, which has only three \\nsignificant figures. In certain cases, it is not clear just how many significant fig-\\nures are implied. Consider the number 100. With the number presented as 100, \\nwe might mean that the value of the number is exactly 100. But the two zeros \\nmight not be significant and we might mean that the value is approximately \\n100—say, 100±10. The number of significant figures in such a case is uncertain. \\nUsually, the number of significant figures can be deduced from the statement \\nof the problem. It is the writer’s obligation to indicate clearly the number of \\nsignificant figures by appropriate use of decimal points and zeros. Thus, 100.0 \\nhas four significant figures and 35 × 103 has two significant figures.\\n\\nA common convention is that 100 is interpreted as having one significant \\nfigure (the two zeros are taken to represent the placeholders), and 100. (with \\n\\n\\n\\na decimal place after the last zero) is interpreted as having three significant \\nfigures. However, this convention is by no means a standard practiced by all au-\\nthors, and it still leaves no way to express 100±10 except by the use of scientific \\nnotation, as 1.0 × 102. Thus, it is preferable to express numbers such as 100 in \\nscientific notation to avoid any ambiguity in the number of significant figures \\nimplied.\\n\\nThe rules for determining the significant figures in a measured quantity \\ncan be summarized as follows:\\n\\n 1.   All nonzero digits and zeros between nonzero digits are significant fig-\\nures. For example, 4023 mL has four significant figures.\\n\\n 2.   Zeros used solely to position the decimal point are not significant figures. \\nFor example, 0.000 206 L has three significant figures (underlined). The \\nzeros to the left of the 2 are not significant figures.\\n\\n 3.   If a numerical result ends in one or more zeros to the right of the decimal \\npoint, then those zeros are significant figures. For example, 2.200 grams \\nhas four significant figures.\\n\\n 4.   If a numerical result ends in zeros that are not to the right of a decimal \\npoint, then those zeros may or may not be significant figures. In such cases \\nwe must deduce the number of significant figures from the statement of \\nthe problem. For example, the statement “350 000 spectators lined the pa-\\nrade route” involves a number that probably has only two significant fig-\\nures at best; we infer this because it is obvious that no one actually counted \\nthe spectators.\\n\\n 5.   A useful rule of thumb to use for determining whether or not zeros are sig-\\nnificant figures is that they are not significant if they disappear when sci-\\nentific notation is used. For example, in the number 0.0197 (= 1.97 × 10–2) \\nthe zeros are not significant figures; in the number 0.01090 (= 1.090 × 10–2) \\nthe first two zeros are not significant and the second two are.\\n\\n 6.   Numbers that can be counted exactly, such as 5 trials in an experiment or \\n60 carbon atoms in the formula C60, and defined conversion factors, such \\nas 1 meter = 100 centimeters, are considered exact numbers. For example, \\nif you rode to class with 3 other people, there is no uncertainty to the \\nnumber; it is not possible that there were actually 3.17 other people in the \\nvehicle. Exact numbers have no limit to their precision and do not obey \\nthe rules given for significant figures (or alternatively, may be treated as \\nhaving an infinite number of significant figures).\\n\\nExAMPLE 1-9: State the number of significant figures in each of the fol-\\nlowing numbers: (a) 0.0312; (b) 0.031 20; (c) 312 pages; (d) 3.1200 × 105 \\ngrams\\n\\nSolution:\\n(a) 0.0312 has three significant figures (underlined).\\n\\n(b) 0.031 20 has four significant figures (underlined).\\n\\n(c) 312 pages is an exact (countable) number.\\n\\n(d) 3.1200 × 105 grams has five significant figures (underlined); grams is a \\nmeasured (not counted) unit.\\n\\n1-7.

Calculated Numerical Results Should Show the Correct \\nNumber of Significant Figures\\n\\nIn scientific calculations we must express the final numerical result with the \\ncorrect number of significant figures; otherwise, an incorrect impression of the \\nprecision of the results is conveyed.\\n\\nIn multiplication and division, the calculated result should not be expressed to more \\nsignificant figures than the factor in the calculation with the least number of significant \\nfigures. For example, if we perform the multiplication 8.3145 × 298.2 on a hand \\ncalculator, the following result comes up on the calculator display: 2479.3839. \\nHowever, not all the figures in this result are significant. The correct result is \\n2479 because the factor 298.2 has only four significant figures; thus, the result \\ncannot have more than four significant figures. The extra figures are not sig-\\nnificant and should be discarded.\\n\\nExAMPLE 1-10: Determine the result to the correct number of significant \\nfigures:\\n\\ny  =  \\n 2.90 × 0.082 05 × 298 \\n\\n      0.93\\n\\nSolution: Using a hand calculator, we obtain\\n\\ny = 76.244 742\\n\\nThe factor 0.93 has the least number of significant figures—only two. \\nThus, the calculated result is valid to only two significant figures. The cor-\\nrect result is y = 76.\\n\\nPRACTICE PROBLEM 1-10: Determine the result of the following calcu-\\nlation to the correct number of significant figures:\\n\\ny  =  \\n 8.314 × 298.15 \\n\\n    96 485.3\\n\\nAnswer: 0.02569\\n\\nIn addition or subtraction, the calculated result should have no more figures after the \\ndecimal point than the least number of figures after the decimal point in any of the num-\\nbers that are being added or subtracted. Consider the sum\\n\\n\\n\\n6.939 \\n + 1.007  07\\n\\n7.946  07 = 7.946\\n\\nThe last two digits in 7.946 07 are not significant, because we know the value \\nof the first number in the addition, 6.939, to only three digits beyond the deci-\\nmal point. Thus, the result cannot be accurate to more than three digits past \\nthe decimal point. Therefore, our result expressed to the correct number of \\nsignificant figures is 7.946. Here we have drawn a vertical red line to emphasize \\nthe cutoff for the last significant figure based on the number with the least \\nnumber of significant figures after the decimal point.\\n\\nNow consider the subtraction\\n\\ny = 1.750 × 106 – 2.50 × 104\\n\\nHere we must express each number to the same power of 10 and then perform \\nthe subtraction to determine the number of significant figures in the result. \\nThus, we begin by rewriting 2.50 × 104 as 0.0250 × 106 and then perform the \\nsubtraction.\\n\\n1.750 × 106\\n\\n – 0.0250 × 106\\n\\n1.725 × 106\\n\\nThe correct answer is y = 1.725 × 106 to four significant figures. (We could \\njust as well have solved this problem by converting 1.750 × 106 to a power of \\n104.)\\n\\nIn discarding nonsignificant figures, we use the following convention: if the \\ndigit following the last digit retained is a 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, then the preceding digit \\nshould be increased by 1; otherwise (i.e., for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), the preceding \\ndigit should be left unchanged. Thus, rounding off the following numbers to \\nthree significant figures, we obtain 27.35 → 27.4, 27.34 → 27.3, and 27.348 → \\n27.3. Note that in half of the cases (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) we discard the nonsignificant \\ndigit, and in the other half (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) we increase the preceding digit by 1 \\nwhen we discard the nonsignificant digits.\\n\\nWhen combining mathematical operations, such as a calculation with a \\nmultiplication step followed by a subtraction step, the number of significant \\nfigures must be calculated separately for each step in the same order that the \\noperations are performed.\\n\\nExAMPLE 1-11: Determine the result of the following calculation to the \\ncorrect number of significant figures:\\n\\ny = 2796.8 – 2795\\n\\nSolution: Subtraction yields 1.8, which we must round off to 2, because \\nthe second number (2795) has no digits to the right of the decimal point; \\ntherefore, the correct result should have no digits to the right of the deci-\\nmal point and have only one significant figure.\\n\\n1-8. CALCULATED NUMERICAL RESULTS 23\\n\\n\\n\\n1.

Following \\nthe rules for addition and subtraction of significant figures, the addition \\nstep yields the value 12.1 g·cm–3. Because the number of trials (4) is an \\nexact number, we ignore the rules for significant figures in the division \\nby 4, so our answer has three significant figures. Note that in this case the \\naverage experimental density has more significant figures than any of the \\nindividual measurements. This is not unusual because an average is gen-\\nerally more precise than any of the individual measurements from which \\nit results. Thus, even for experiments with relatively large inherent mea-\\nsurement errors, one method of increasing the precision is to make many \\nrepeated measurements and average the results.\\n\\nPRACTICE PROBLEM 1-12: A reference book lists the density of alumi-\\nnum as 2.70 g·cm–3. Calculate the percentage error in the average density \\nof the aluminum object determined in Example 1-12 to the correct number \\nof significant figures.\\n\\nAnswer: 12% (two significant figures)\\n\\nThe rule for addition and subtraction of \\nsignificant figures is different from that  \\nfor multiplication and division. You should \\nkeep this in mind when calculating \\naverages or determining percentage \\nerrors.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn general, to avoid compounding rounding errors, it is best to perform all \\nmathematical calculations to extra significant figures first and then trim the fi-\\nnal answer to the correct number of significant figures, based on the operation \\nin each step. For example, consider the operation\\n\\ny = (1.0 + 0.46)3\\n\\nThe addition in the first step yields 1.0 + 0.46 = 1.46, which is equal to 1.5 to \\nthe correct number of significant figures. Cubing this number yields\\n\\ny = (1.5)3 = 3.375 = 3.4\\n\\nto two significant figures (because cubing a number is the same as multiplying \\nit by itself three times, we apply the rules for multiplication to powers). How-\\never, if we perform the same calculation on a handheld calculator and then \\ntrim the result to two significant figures, we get\\n\\ny = (1.0 + 0.46)3 = (1.46)3 = 3.112 136 = 3.1\\n\\nThus, rounding in each step yields an overall error greater than our assumed \\nprecision in the last significant digit. That is,\\n\\n3.4 ± 0.1 \\ue0de 3.1 ± 0.1\\n\\nIn general, the more steps in an operation, the more such rounding errors \\ncan compound. Thus, to avoid rounding errors, it’s best to perform all math-\\nematical operations to extra significant figures first and then trim the final \\nanswer to the correct number of significant figures, based on the operations \\nperformed.\\n\\n1-9.  Dimensional Analysis Is Used to Simplify Many Types  \\nof Chemical Calculations\\n\\nDimensional analysis is a particularly useful method for calculations that in-\\nvolve quantities with units. The basic idea involved in dimensional analysis is to \\ntreat the units of the various quantities involved in the calculations as quantities \\nthat follow the rules of algebra. The calculation is set up in such a way that the \\nundesired units cancel out and the numerical answer is obtained in the desired \\nunits. If the answer obtained does not have the desired units, then we know that \\nthe procedure used to obtain the result is incorrect.\\n\\nLet’s consider some specific examples of the use of dimensional analysis \\nin calculations. Only numbers that have the same units can be added or sub-\\ntracted. If we add 2.12 cm and 4.73 cm, we obtain 6.85 cm. If we wish to add  \\n76.4 cm to 1.19 m, we must first convert 76.4 cm to meters or 1.19 m to centi-\\nmeters. We convert from one unit to another by using a unit conversion factor. \\nSuppose we want to convert meters to centimeters. In Appendix B we find that\\n\\n 1 m = 100 cm (1.7)\\n\\n1-9. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS IS USED TO SIMPLIFY CALCULATIONS 25\\n\\nIn carrying out calculations involving \\nseveral steps, the final answer depends \\nupon how many digits you keep in the \\nintermediate steps, which is somewhat \\narbitrary. Although it is important to \\nreport answers to the correct number \\nof significant figures, answers that differ \\na little in the last significant digit are \\nnot significantly different because of the \\nuncertainty associated with this last \\ndigit. For example, a result reported \\nto four significant figures that reads \\n0.3456 or 0.3457 is not significantly \\ndifferent. \\n\\n\\n\\n1. CHEMISTRY AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD26\\n\\nEquation 1.7 is a definition and therefore exact; there is no limit to the num-\\nber of significant figures on either side of the equation. If we divide both sides \\nof Equation 1.7 by 1 m, we get\\n\\n1 =   100 cm  (1.8)\\n      1 m\\n\\nEquation 1.8 is called a unit conversion factor, because we can use it to con-\\nvert a number in meters to a number in centimeters by multiplying the number \\nin meters by the unit conversion factor in Equation 1.8. A unit conversion factor, \\nas shown in Equation 1.8, is equal to unity; thus, we can multiply any quantity by \\na unit conversion factor without changing its intrinsic value. If we multiply 1.19 \\nmeters by the unit conversion factor in Equation 1.8, then we obtain\\n\\n       (1.19 m)\\ue031 100 cm \\ue032 = 119 cm\\n     1 m\\n\\nNotice that the unit of meter cancels, giving the final result in centimeters. \\nTo convert 76.4 centimeters to meters, we use the reciprocal of Equation 1.8:\\n\\n  (76.4 cm)\\ue031    1 m    \\ue032 =  0.764 m100 cm\\nNotice in this case that the unit of centimeter cancels out, giving the final result \\nin meters. From these results, we see that the sum of 76.4 cm and 1.19 meters is\\n\\n  76.4 cm + (1.19 m) \\ue031  100 cm  \\ue032 =  195 cm                1 m\\nor\\n\\n  (76.4 cm) \\ue031    1 m    \\ue032 + 1.19 m =  1.95 m100 cm\\nNotice that both results are given to three significant figures.\\n\\nAs another example of converting from one set of units to another, let’s \\nconvert 55 miles per hour (conventionally abbreviated mph) to kilometers per \\nhour. From the inside of the back cover, we find that\\n\\n 1 mile = 1.609 km (1.9)\\n\\nDividing both sides of Equation 1.9 by 1 mile yields the unit conversion  \\nfactor\\n\\n 1 =  \\n 1.609 km  (1.10)\\n\\n          1 mile\\n\\nEquation 1.10 is the unit conversion factor that is used to convert a speed given \\nin miles per hour to a speed in kilometers per hour. Thus,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ue031  55 miles  \\ue032 \\ue031  1.609 km  \\ue032 =  89 km·h–11 hour             1 mile\\nNote that the use of the proper units for each quantity provides an inter-\\n\\nnal check on the correctness of the calculation. We must multiply 55 mph by  \\n1.609 km/1 mile to obtain the result in the desired units of km·h–1. Also note \\nthat if we had used the conversion 1 km = 0.6214 miles from the inside of the \\nback cover, then the unit conversion would be\\n\\n\\ue031  55 miles  \\ue032 \\ue031          1 km        \\ue032 =  89 km·h–11 hour            0.6214 miles\\nand the unit of miles once again cancels out.\\n\\nExAMPLE 1-13: Given that the unit conversion factor for the conversion \\nof U.S. quarts to milliliters is 946.3 mL per quart (qt) and 1 L = 1000 mL, \\ncompute the number of liters in 1.00 U.S. gallon (gal) of gasoline. (There \\nare 4 quarts in a U.S. gallon.)\\n\\nSolution: Before starting, it is a good idea to create a plan of how we \\nwill perform the given conversion. Our objective is to convert gallons to \\nliters. We can illustrate this process using an arrow to represent the plan  \\nas follows:\\n\\ngallons —→ liters\\n\\nBecause we are given conversions from gallons to quarts, we can write\\n\\ngallons ——→ quarts ——→ liters\\n\\nas the first step in our plan. Continuing in this way, we outline a plan for \\nthe overall required conversion:\\n\\ngallons ———→ quarts ————→ milliliters ————→ liters\\n\\nThen using the given conversion factors and making sure the units cancel \\n(as shown in red), we find number of liters of gasoline in 1.00 gallon of \\ngasoline is\\n\\n(1.00 gal)\\ue031  4 qt  \\ue032 \\ue031  946.3 mL  \\ue032 \\ue031      1 L       \\ue032 =  3.79 L1 gal             1 qt             1000 mL\\nAfter some practice you will begin to “see” the plan in your head and \\n\\nwill no longer need to write it out stepwise when working problems of this \\nnature, but you should still always write out all the conversion factors and \\ntheir units when performing a calculation. The canceling of unit conver-\\nsion factors is an excellent double-check that you have performed all your \\ncalculations correctly.\\n\\n?\\n\\n?4 qt/gal\\n\\n946.3 mL/qt 1 L/1000 mL\\n\\n1-9.

It has been estimated that all the gold that has ever \\nbeen mined would occupy a cube 19 meters on a side (Figure 1.16). Given that \\nthe density of gold is 19.3 g·cm–3, let’s calculate the mass of all this gold. The \\nvolume of a cube 19 meters on a side is\\n\\n volume = (19 m)3 = 6859 m3 (1.11)\\n\\nAlthough the volume calculated in Equation 1.11 is good to only two sig-\\nnificant figures (because the value 19 meters is good to only two significant \\nfigures), we shall carry extra significant figures through the calculation and \\nthen round off the final result to two significant figures. (As discussed before, \\nthis procedure minimizes accumulation of round-off errors in the calculation.) \\nThe mass of the gold is obtained by multiplying the density by the volume; but \\nbefore doing this, we must convert cubic meters to cubic centimeters because \\nthe density is given in g·cm–3. From Appendix B, we find that\\n\\n1 m = 100 cm\\n\\nBy cubing both sides of this expression, we obtain\\n\\n\\n\\n(1 m)3 = (100 cm)3 = 1 × 106 cm3\\n\\nso the unit conversion factor is\\n\\n 1 =  \\n 106 cm3  \\n\\n       1 m3\\n\\nThus, the volume in cubic centimeters is equal to\\n\\nvolume = (6859 m3) \\ue031  10\\n6 cm3  \\ue032  =  6.859 × 109 cm3          1 m3\\n\\nIf we multiply the volume of the gold by the density of gold, then we obtain \\nthe mass of the gold:\\n\\nmass = volume × density \\n= (6.859 × 109 cm3) (19.3 g·cm–3 ) = 1.3 × 1011 g\\n\\nThe result is rounded off to two significant figures, because, as we mentioned \\nbefore, the side of the cube (19 meters) is given to only two significant figures. \\nIn obtaining this result, we have used the fact that (cm3)(cm–3) = 1.\\n\\nLet’s see what this mass of gold would be worth at $850 per troy ounce (troy \\noz), the price of gold in February 2009. (Gold is sold by the troy ounce, which is \\nabout 10% heavier than the avoirdupois ounce, the unit used for foods.) There \\nare 31.1 grams in 1 troy ounce, so the unit conversion factor is\\n\\n 1 =  \\n  1 troy oz   \\n\\n          31.1 g\\n\\nThe mass of the gold in troy ounces is\\n\\nmass = (1.3 × 1011 g) \\ue031  1 troy oz  \\ue032                         31.1 g\\n= 4.2 × 109 troy oz\\n\\nAt $850 per troy ounce, the value in U.S. dollars of all the gold ever mined is\\n\\nvalue = (4.2 × 109 troy oz) \\ue031     $850     \\ue032                           1 troy oz\\n= $3.6 × 1012 = 3.6 trillion U.S. dollars\\n\\nScientific calculations involve ways of handling numbers and units that may \\nbe new to you. If, however, you carefully set up the necessary conversion factors \\nand make certain that the appropriate units cancel to give the units required \\nfor the answer—that is, if you use the dimensional analysis approach—then \\nmaking unit conversions becomes a straightforward procedure.\\n\\n1-9. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS IS USED TO SIMPLIFY CALCULATIONS 29\\n\\n\\n\\n1. CHEMISTRY AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD30\\n\\n1-10.  The Guggenheim Notation Is Used to Label Table Headings \\nand the Axes of Graphs\\n\\nIn presenting tables of quantities with units, it is convenient to use a column \\nheading to specify the units rather than writing out the units next to each nu-\\nmerical entry. The least ambiguous way to do this is to write the name or symbol \\nof the quantity followed by a slash and the symbol for the units. For example, \\nthe heading “Distance/m” indicates that the units of the numerical entries are \\ndistances expressed in meters. This notation is called the Guggenheim nota-\\ntion after E. A. Guggenheim, the British chemist who proposed its use.\\n\\nTo see how Guggenheim notation works, let’s suppose that we wish to tabu-\\nlate a number of masses, such as 1.604 grams, 2.763 grams, and 3.006 grams. \\nWe use the Guggenheim notation, “Mass/g,” in the heading and list the masses \\nas numbers without units, as shown in Table 1.4, column (a). Now suppose that \\nlater we wish to retrieve the values with their units. The heading indicates that \\nthe numbers in the column are masses divided by grams, so we write, for exam-\\nple, mass/g = 1.604. We can multiply both sides of the equation by g to obtain \\nmass = 1.604 grams. Note that the heading is treated as an algebraic quantity \\nand that we retrieve the data through an algebraic process.\\n\\nThe Guggenheim notation is particularly convenient when the values to be \\ntabulated are expressed in scientific notation. Suppose that we wish to tabulate \\nthe masses 1.29 × 10–4 grams, 3.58 × 10–4 grams, and 7.16 × 10–4 grams. In this \\ncase we can use the heading “Mass/10–4 g” to simplify these tabulated data, as \\nshown in Table 1.4, column (b). To retrieve the data from the table, we write, \\nfor example, mass/10–4 g = 1.29, from which we get mass = 1.29 × 10–4 grams. \\nNotice that the Guggenheim notation enables us to list tabular entries as unit-\\nless numbers.\\n\\nExAMPLE 1-15: Consider the following tabulated data:\\n\\nTime/10–5 s Speed/105 m·s–1\\n\\n1.00 3.061\\n\\n1.50 4.153\\n\\n2.00 6.302\\n\\n 2.50 8.999\\n\\nRetrieve the actual data—the values and their units for time and speed, \\nrespectively—as four data pairs.\\n\\nSolution: To find the actual times, we use, for example, time/10–5 s = 1.00, \\nfrom which we obtain time = 1.00 × 10–5 s. The corresponding speed is \\ngiven by speed/105 m·s–1 = 3.061, or speed = 3.061 × 105 m·s–1. The other \\ndata pairs are 1.50 × 10–5 s, 4.153 × 105 m·s–1; 2.00 × 10–5 s, 6.302 × 105 m·s–1; \\nand 2.50 × 10–5 s, 8.999 × 105 m·s–1.\\n\\n(a) Mass/g (b) Mass/10–4 g\\n\\n 1.604 1.29\\n\\n 2.763 3.58\\n\\n 3.006 7.16\\n\\nTABLE 1.4 Tabulated data \\nwith headings in the  \\nGuggenheim notation\\n\\n\\n\\nPRACTICE PROBLEM 1-15: The SI unit for the quantity of electrical \\ncharge is a coulomb (C).

The Guggenheim notation is especially useful for the \\ngraphical presentation of data because only dimensionless quantities can be \\ngraphed, and the retrieval of quantities with appropriate units from the graph \\nis unambiguous when the Guggenheim notation is used on the graph axes.\\n\\nExAMPLE 1-16: Use the Guggenheim notation to label the graph axes \\nand plot the following data:\\n\\n\\t v/m·s–1 t/s\\n\\n 0 0\\n\\n 16 1.0\\n\\n 64 2.0\\n\\n 144 3.0\\n\\n 256 4.0\\n\\nSolution: On a suitable piece of graph paper (Figure 1.17), we mark off \\nthe vertical axis (v/m·s–1) and the horizontal axis (t/s). The data pairs are \\nthe coordinates of the various points on the graph and thus are used to \\nposition the points on the graph. Once the points are located, we draw a \\nsmooth curve through the points.\\n\\nPRACTICE PROBLEM 1-16: Replot the data given in Example 1-16 in \\nthe form v versus t 2.

CHEMISTRY AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD32\\n\\nThe Guggenheim notation has been adopted by the International Union of \\nPure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), and is the officially recommended nota-\\ntion for labeling columns of data in tables and axes of graphs. Although older, \\nless convenient, and often ambiguous, alternative conventions are still in use, \\nthey are being phased out in the scientific literature.\\n\\nThis section concludes our discussion of units and various aspects of sci-\\nentific calculations, including dimensional analysis and significant figures. \\nThe next chapter is devoted to developing an understanding of the nature of \\nelements and chemical compounds within the framework of Dalton’s atomic \\ntheory.\\n\\nSUMMARY\\nChemistry is an experimental science based on the scientific method. Scientific \\nquestions are answered by carrying out appropriate experiments. Scientific laws \\nare concise summaries of large numbers of experimental observations. Scien-\\ntific theories are designed to provide explanations for the laws and observa-\\ntions, and are subject to ongoing refinement based on new observations and \\nresults.\\n\\nThe internationally sanctioned units for scientific measurements are the SI \\nunits. The basic SI unit for length is the meter, the basic SI unit for mass is the \\nkilogram, and the basic SI unit for temperature is the kelvin. Compound units \\nare combinations of basic SI units.\\n\\nThe SI unit of energy is the joule. Two forms of energy that we discussed \\nin this chapter are kinetic energy, which is due to the motion of an object, and \\npotential energy, which is due to its position. Although kinetic, potential, and \\nother forms of energy may be exchanged, the total energy must always be con-\\nserved.\\n\\nAccuracy and precision can be assessed using percentage error and signifi-\\ncant figures, respectively. To carry out scientific calculations, you need to un-\\nderstand significant figures, units of measurement, and unit conversion factors. \\nThere are rules for determining the correct number of significant figures in a \\ncalculated result. Units must always be included with numbers that represent \\nthe results of measurements; otherwise, the numbers are meaningless. Simi-\\nlar quantities must be converted to the same type of units before they can be \\nused together in calculations. Unit conversions are made with unit conversion \\nfactors. The general procedure for setting up a scientific calculation in such a \\nway that all the units but those desired in the final result cancel out is called \\ndimensional analysis.\\n\\nGuggenheim notation is used to label table entries and graph axes so that \\nwe can retrieve without ambiguity the entries in a table or a graph and their \\nappropriate units.\\n\\nThe International Union of Pure \\nand Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) \\nis an international organization \\nthat proposes the units, symbols, \\nconventions, and nomenclature to \\nbe used by scientists throughout \\nthe world.

She worked as a \\ngoverness to support her older sister’s study of medicine in Paris. In 1891, she joined \\nher sister to study at the University of Paris. She received her doctorate of science \\ndegree there in 1903, the first woman in France to do so. While there she met and \\nmarried Pierre Curie, a member of the University’s physics faculty. Together they \\nstudied radioactive materials and isolated the radioactive elements radium and \\npolonium (which they named) in their dilapidated laboratory. In 1903, she and \\nPierre were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics along with Henri Becquerel, the \\ndiscoverer of radioactivity. In 1911, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\nfor her discovery and isolation of radium and polonium. In spite of wide scientific \\nacclaim, she was not elected to the French Academy of Sciences because of the \\nprevailing prejudice against women. She died from aplastic anemia, almost certainly \\ndue to exposure to radiation.\\n\\nIrene Joliet-Curie (1897–1956), left, was born in Paris to Marie and Pierre Curie. She \\nhad an unconventional early education, but eventually entered the Sorbonne. Her \\neducation was interrupted by World War I, during which she and her mother ran 20 \\nmobile field hospitals equipped with primitive X-ray equipment. After the war, she \\nentered the Radium Institute, founded by her parents in Paris, and completed her \\ndoctorate in 1925. While a student there, she instructed Frederic Joliet in techniques \\nfor research involving radioactive material. They married and together continued \\nthe study of atomic nuclei. The two created radioactive nitrogen, phosphorus, and \\nsilicon from nonradioactive isotopes. In 1935, they were awarded the Nobel Prize \\nin Chemistry for their discovery of artificial radioactivity. A laboratory accident \\ninvolving polonium led to Irene’s developing a fatal case of leukemia. Marie and \\nIrene Curie are the only mother-daughter recipients of the Nobel Prize.\\n\\n\\n\\n41\\n\\n2.  Atoms and Molecules\\n\\nThe millions of chemicals known today are made up of little more than 100 elementary components—the chemical elements. In the early 1800s, an \\nEnglish schoolteacher named John Dalton drew on the idea of the elements and \\ntheir chemical combinations to propose the atomic theory. Dalton began with \\nthe idea of structureless, solid spheres, which he called atoms. In Dalton’s atomic \\ntheory, all substances consist either of atoms or molecules (which are groups of \\natoms joined together). Dalton’s theory gives a simple picture of chemical reac-\\ntions and explains countless chemical observations. Building on Dalton’s work, \\nexperiments in the last years of the nineteenth century and the early years of \\nthe twentieth century led to a dramatically new view of the atom—the nuclear \\nmodel.\\n\\n2-1. Elements Are the Simplest Substances\\nAlmost all the millions of different chemicals known today can be broken down \\ninto simpler substances. Any substance that cannot be broken down into sim-\\npler substances is called an element. A substance that can be broken down into \\ntwo or more elements is called a compound. Before the early 1800s, many sub-\\nstances were classified incorrectly as elements because methods to break them \\ndown had not yet been developed, but these errors were gradually rectified over \\nthe years. Although our definition of an element is a satisfactory working defini-\\ntion at this stage, we shall soon learn the modern definition of an element: An \\nelement is a substance that consists only of atoms with the same nuclear charge.\\n\\nThere are currently almost 120 known chemical elements. It turns out that \\n99.99% of all known substances are made from only about 40 elements, which \\nmakes the other 80 fairly rare. Table 2.1 lists the most common elements found \\nin the earth’s crust, oceans, and atmosphere (but not the core, which is thought \\nto be mostly iron). Note that only 10 elements make up over 99% of the total \\nmass. Oxygen and silicon are the most common elements on earth; they are the \\nmajor constituents of sand, soil, and rocks. Oxygen also occurs as a free element \\nin the atmosphere and in combination with hydrogen in water. Table 2.2 lists \\nthe most common elements found in the human body. Again, only 10 elements \\nconstitute over 99% of the total mass of the human body. Because about 70% \\nof the mass of the human body is water, much of this mass is oxygen and hy-\\n\\n 2-1 Elements and Their Chemical Symbols\\n\\n 2-2 States of Matter\\n\\n 2-3 Separation of Mixtures\\n\\n 2-4 The Law of Constant Composition\\n\\n 2-5 Dalton’s Atomic Theory\\n\\n 2-6 Molecules\\n\\n2-7 Chemical Nomenclature\\n\\n2-8 Atomic and Molecular Mass\\n\\n2-9 The Nucleus\\n\\n2-10 Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons\\n\\n2-11 Isotopes\\n\\n2-12 Ions\\n\\nElement\\t Percent\\tby\\tmass\\n\\noxygen 49.1\\n\\nsilicon 26.1\\n\\naluminum 7.5\\n\\niron 4.7\\n\\ncalcium 3.4\\n\\nsodium 2.6\\n\\npotassium 2.4\\n\\nmagnesium 1.9\\n\\nhydrogen 0.88\\n\\ntitanium 0.58\\n\\nchlorine 0.19\\n\\ncarbon 0.09\\n\\nall others 0.56\\n\\nTAblE 2.1 Elemental composition \\nof the earth’s surface, which includes \\nthe crust, oceans, and atmosphere\\n\\n\\n\\n2.

Outside of planet Earth, evidence from the study of the spectra of stars \\nand nebulae suggest that one element, hydrogen, accounts for more than 90% \\nof the atoms and about 75% of the observable mass of the universe. The other \\nelements are thought to be the by-products of nuclear processes occurring in \\nstars.\\n\\nThe elements can be divided into two broad classes: metals and nonmetals. \\nWe are all familiar with the properties of solid metals. They have a character-\\nistic luster, can be cast into various shapes, and are usually good conductors of \\nelectricity and heat. In addition, they are malleable, a term that means they can \\nbe rolled or hammered into sheets, and ductile, a term that means they can be \\ndrawn into wires.\\n\\nAbout three-fourths of the elements are metals. All the metals except mer-\\ncury are solids at room temperature (about 20°C). Mercury is a shiny, silver-\\ncolored liquid at room temperature (Figure 2.1). Mercury used to be called \\nquicksilver because of its silvery luster and the tendency of drops of mercury to \\nroll rapidly on nonlevel surfaces.\\n\\nTable 2.3 lists some common metals and their chemical symbols, and Figure \\n2.2 shows some of these metals. Chemical\\tsymbols are abbreviations used to \\ndesignate the elements. They usually consist of the first one or two letters in the \\nname of the element, but some chemical symbols do not seem to correspond \\nat all to the elements’ names. These symbols are derived from the Latin names \\nof the elements (Table 2.4). You should memorize the chemical symbols of the \\nmore common elements because we shall be using them throughout this book. \\nThe origins of the names of the elements are discussed in Interchapter A.\\n\\nUnlike metals, nonmetals vary greatly in their appearance. Over half of the \\nnonmetals are gases at room temperature; the others are solids, except for bro-\\nmine, which is a red-brown, corrosive liquid (Figure 2.1). In contrast to metals, \\n\\nFigure 2.1 Mercury and bromine are \\nthe only elements that are liquids \\nat room temperature (20°C).

AToMS And MolECulES44\\n\\nBoth the metals and nonmetals can be further subdivided into various sub-\\nclasses and groups based on their physical and chemical properties. These will \\nbe treated in detail in Chapter 3 and the Interchapters.\\n\\n2-2. The States of Matter Include Solids, liquids, and Gases\\nIn nature, pure elements and compounds are found in various physical states. \\nThese states\\tof\\tmatter include solids, liquids, and gases. Although you probably \\nalready have some familiarity with these various states of matter, we shall briefly \\ndefine each of these states in turn.\\n\\nWe have already seen that all the metallic elements (except mercury) are \\nsolids at room temperature. Many compounds you are familiar with, such as ta-\\nble salt, limestone, and quartz, also exist as solids at room temperature. A solid \\ncan be characterized as having a fixed volume and a fixed shape because the \\nparticles that make up a solid are held together in a rigid, well-defined lattice \\n(Figure 2.5a). Later on we shall learn about the forces between the constituent \\nparticles of a solid that hold them in fixed lattices and learn to characterize vari-\\nous kinds of different solids. Not all solids are hard or rigid. For example, gold \\nis quite soft and malleable, a property that allows it to be worked into jewelry or \\nthin sheets known as gold leaf.\\n\\nA solid is denoted by placing an italic letter s  in parenthesis after the chemi-\\ncal symbol or formula of the solid element or molecule. For example, at room \\ntemperature iron and table salt are solids, so we write their chemical formulas \\nas Fe(s) and NaCl(s) to indicate the states of these substances. We shall do this \\nthroughout the book to help you remember the state of various substances at \\nroom temperature. (We shall learn how to write the chemical formulas of com-\\npounds later in this text; for now these are simply given by way of illustration.)\\n\\nA liquid is a substance that has a definite volume, but not a specific shape. \\nWhen poured into a container, a liquid fills up the container to the extent of \\nits volume and conforms to the shape of the container. In doing so, it forms a \\nsurface within the container. Like a solid, the particles in a liquid are held to-\\ngether by the forces between them. However, in contrast to a solid, the particles \\nin a liquid are not fixed in their positions but are free to move about within the \\nvolume of the liquid (Figure 2.5b). Even though a liquid has a fixed volume, \\nit does not have a fixed shape because its constituent particles are not held in \\nfixed positions. Only two elements, mercury and bromine, are liquids at room \\ntemperature. Many familiar compounds such as water and ethanol (the alcohol \\nfound in alcoholic beverages) exist as liquids at room temperature. A liquid is \\ndenoted by placing an italic letter l in parenthesis after the chemical symbol or \\nformula of the liquid; for example, the formulas of liquid mercury, liquid bro-\\nmine, and liquid water are written as Hg(l ), Br2(l ) and H2O(l ), respectively.\\n\\nA gas is a substance that fills the entire volume of its container and thus has \\nno definite shape. The particles comprising a gas tend to be widely separated \\nand move rapidly about within the volume of the gas (Figure 2.5c). In contrast \\nto solids and liquids, it is relatively easy to change the volume of a gas by altering \\nthe size of its container. For example, a gas may be compressed inside a piston \\nsuch as a bicycle pump. We shall study gases in more detail in Chapter 13. A gas \\nis denoted by placing an italic letter g in parenthesis after the chemical sym-\\nbol or formula of the gaseous element or compound. For example, nitrogen,  \\noxygen, and carbon dioxide are all gases at room temperature and normal at-\\n\\nWe shall include the phases of \\ncompounds at room temperature.  \\nYou are certainly not expected to \\nknow these (few chemists do).

A Mixture Can be Separated by Taking Advantage of  \\nthe different physical properties of Its Components\\n\\nMost substances in nature occur as mixtures, in which the component sub-\\nstances exist together without combining chemically. A familiar example of \\na mixture is air, which consists of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen with small \\namounts of argon, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. Another example is a mix-\\nture of salt and pepper. Not only most naturally occurring substances but also \\nmany laboratory preparations consist of mixtures.\\n\\nWhen determining physical properties such as density or melting point or \\nthe chemical properties of an element or a compound, chemists must be certain \\nthat the substance is reasonably pure, otherwise the results have very limited \\napplicability in that they are restricted to the particular impure sample that was \\nstudied. Thus, it is often necessary for chemists to separate the various pure \\ncomponents from a mixture.\\n\\nLet’s consider the problem of separating a mixture composed of sugar, \\nsand, iron filings, and gold dust into its four components (Figure 2.6). The \\nfirst thing to recognize about the mixture is that it is heterogeneous; that is, it \\nis not uniform from point to point. The heterogeneity of the mixture can be \\nseen clearly with the aid of a microscope (Figure 2.6c). We could separate the \\nfour components of the mixture by using tweezers, a microscope, and a lot of \\ntime and patience; however, we can achieve much more rapid separations with \\nother methods. We can separate the iron filings from the mixture by using a \\n\\n(a) Solid (b) Liquid (c) Gas\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n02/20/10 \\n\\n002-005\\n\\nx\\n\\nFigure 2.5 (a) A solid, like the one \\nillustrated here, is rigid and does not \\nassume the shape of its container.

(b) A liquid fills  \\nits container to a definite volume \\nand forms a surface, such as the one \\nillustrated here. From a microscopic \\nview, in a liquid the particles are held \\ntogether by forces between the particles, \\nbut are still free to move about randomly \\nthroughout the volume of the liquid.  \\n(c) A gas fills the entire container. From \\na microscopic view, a gas consists of \\nrapidly moving particles that are free \\nto move about the full volume of the \\ncontainer. However, most of the volume \\nof a gas is empty space.\\n\\n2-3. A MIxTurE CAn bE SEpArATEd bY TAkInG AdvAnTAGE oF ThE dIFFErEnT phYSICAl propErTIES 45\\n\\n\\n\\n2.

The same technique is used on a much \\nlarger scale in waste recycling to separate substances that are strongly attracted \\nto a magnetic (e.g., iron, steel, nickel) from those that are not (e.g., aluminum, \\nglass, paper, and plastics).\\n\\nAfter the iron has been removed from our mixture, the sugar can be sepa-\\nrated from the remaining components by adding water. We call this process \\ndissolution. Only the sugar dissolves in the water to form a solution of sugar in \\nwater.\\n\\nA solution is a homogeneous (i.e., uniform from point to point) mixture \\nof two or more components. The components of a solution do not have to be \\na solid and a liquid; there are many types of solutions. For example, a mixture \\nof various nonreactive gases is a solution. However, the most common type of \\nsolution is a solid dissolved in a liquid. The solid that is dissolved is called the \\nsolute, and the liquid in which it is dissolved is called the solvent. The terms \\nsolvent and solute are merely terms of convenience, because all the components \\nof a solution are uniformly dispersed throughout the solution (Figure 2.7). The \\nmost common solvent that we shall encounter in chemistry is water, H2O(l ). \\nWhen a substance is dissolved in water, we say that it forms an aqueous\\tsolution \\nand denote its state using the symbol (aq). The sugar dissolved in water that \\n\\nFigure 2.6 (a) A mixture of sugar, \\nsand, iron filings, and gold dust. \\nThe components of the mixture \\ncannot be determined by casual \\ninspection.

The iron filings are \\nattracted by the magnet, but the \\nother three components are not.\\n\\n(a) (b) \\n\\n(c) (d) \\n\\n\\n\\nwe have been discussing is an example of an aqueous solution. We denote the \\nchemical formula of the sugar in the solution as C12H22O11(aq) to indicate that \\nit is dissolved in water.\\n\\nLet’s return to our example. The formation of the sugar-water solution \\nleaves the sand and gold particles at the bottom of the container. The hetero-\\ngeneous mixture of gold, sand, and sugar-water solution can then be separated \\nby filtration (Figure 2.8). The sugar-water solution passes readily through the \\nsmall pores in the filter paper, but the solid gold and sand particles are too large \\nto pass through and are trapped on the paper. The sugar can be recovered \\nfrom the sugar-water solution by evaporating the water, a process that leaves \\nthe recrystallized sugar in the container. Salts are separated from seawater and \\nbrines on a commercial scale by the evaporation of the water from the brines \\n(Figure 2.9).\\n\\nThe sand and gold dust can be separated by panning or by sluice-box tech-\\nniques, which rely on the differences in density of the two solids to achieve \\na separation. In simple panning, water is added to the mixture of sand and \\ngold and the slurry is swirled in a shallow, saucer-shaped metal pan. The dense  \\n(19.3 g·cm−3) gold particles collect near the center of the pan, whereas the less \\ndense sand particles (2 to 3 g·cm−3) swirl out of the pan. In the sluice-box tech-\\nnique, running water is passed over an agitated sand-gold mixture; the less \\ndense sand particles, which rise higher in the water than the gold, are swept \\naway in the stream of water.\\n\\nWhen fine gold particles are firmly attached to sand particles, the gold can \\nbe separated by shaking the mixture with liquid mercury, in which the gold \\ndissolves but the sand does not. The sand, which floats on the mercury, is re-\\nmoved.\\n\\nWe can separate the resulting solution of gold in mercury by taking advan-\\ntage of the different physical properties of each component of the mixture. \\nBecause mercury has a relatively low boiling point (357˚C), while that of gold is \\nquite high (2856˚C), the solution of gold in mercury can be separated by distil-\\nlation, in which the mercury boils away and the solid gold remains behind. The \\nmercury vapors are cooled and thereby converted back to liquid in a condenser. \\nWe call this process condensation.

The law of Constant Composition States That the relative \\nAmount of Each Element in a Compound Is Always the Same\\n\\nThe quantitative approach pioneered by Lavoisier was used in the chemical \\nanalysis of compounds. The quantitative chemical analysis of a great many com-\\npounds led to the law\\tof\\tconstant\\tcomposition: The relative amount of each \\nelement in a particular compound is always the same, regardless of the source \\nof the compound or how the compound was prepared.\\n\\nFor example, if calcium metal is heated with sulfur in the absence of water \\nand oxygen, the compound called calcium sulfide, CaS(s), which is used in fluo-\\nrescent paints, is formed (Figure 2.11). We can specify the relative amounts of \\ncalcium and sulfur in calcium sulfide as the mass\\tpercentage of each element. \\nThe mass percentages of calcium and sulfur in calcium sulfide are given by\\n\\nmass of calcium\\n—\\nmass of calcium sulfide\\n\\n= × 100\\nmass percentage of calcium\\n\\nin calcium sulfide\\n\\nwhere the factor of 100 is necessary to convert the ratio of masses to a percent-\\nage.

It does not matter whether the calcium \\nsulfide is prepared by heating a large amount of calcium with a small amount \\nof sulfur or by heating a small amount of calcium with a large amount of sulfur. \\nSimilarly, the mass percentage of sulfur in calcium sulfide is always 44.4%. Any \\n\\nFigure 2.11 The reaction between \\nthe elements calcium and sulfur \\nyields calcium sulfide, CaS(s).

The \\nprincipal natural source of lead sulfide is an ore known as galena (Figure \\n2.12).\\n\\nprACTICE problEM 2-1: A 5.650-gram sample of a compound contain-\\ning the elements potassium, nitrogen, and oxygen was found to contain \\n38.67% K and 13.86% N.

This law says that when a given element, call it X, combines \\nwith another element, call it Y, to form two different compounds, then X com-\\nbines in such a way that for a fixed mass of X, the ratio of the masses of Y in \\nthe two compounds consists of small whole numbers. This law is best shown \\nby example. Carbon combines with oxygen to form two different compounds. \\nExperiments show that 1.33 grams of oxygen always combine with one gram of \\ncarbon to form the first compound and that 2.66 grams of oxygen always com-\\nbine with one gram of carbon to form the second compound:\\n\\nFigure 2.12 Metal sulfides are \\nvaluable ores of metals.

These data can be readily \\nunderstood if we assume that the first and second compounds have the chemi-\\ncal formulas CO and CO2, respectively, because for a fixed amount of carbon, \\nCO2 contains twice the mass of oxygen as CO.\\n\\nIn another experiment it was found that sulfur and oxygen combine to form \\ntwo compounds with the following data for the masses of oxygen that combined \\nwith one gram of sulfur in each of the two compounds:\\n\\nsulfur\\t+\\toxygen:\\t Mass\\tof\\tsulfur/grams\\t Mass\\tof\\toxygen/grams\\n\\nfirst compound 1.00 1.00\\n\\nsecond compound 1.00 1.50\\n\\nThe ratio of the mass of oxygen in the second compound to that of the first \\nis 1.50/1.00 = 3/2, another small whole number ratio. These data can be un-\\nderstood if we know that the two compounds have the chemical formulas SO2 \\nand SO3, respectively. Later in this text we shall learn how to deduce chemical \\nformulas from such data.\\n\\nThe law of constant composition and the law of multiple proportions were \\nsome of the observations that led to the atomic theory of the elements.\\n\\n2-5.  dalton’s Atomic Theory Explains  \\nthe law of Constant Composition\\n\\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, scientists had analyzed many compounds \\nand had amassed a large amount of experimental data. But they lacked a theory \\nthat could bring all these data into a single framework. In 1803 John Dalton \\n(Figure 2.13), an English elementary school teacher, proposed an atomic\\tthe-\\nory. His theory provided a simple and beautiful explanation of both the law of \\nconstant composition and the law of conservation of mass. We can express the \\npostulates of Dalton’s atomic theory in modern terms as follows:\\n\\n 1.  Matter is composed of small, indivisible particles called atoms.\\n 2.   The atoms of a given element all have the same mass and are identical in \\n\\nall respects, including chemical behavior.\\n 3.  The atoms of different elements differ in mass and in chemical behavior.\\n 4.   Chemical compounds are composed of two or more atoms of different ele-\\n\\nments joined together. The particle that results when two or more atoms \\njoin together is called a molecule.\\n\\n 5.   In a chemical reaction, the atoms involved are rearranged, separated, or \\nrecombined to form new substances. No atoms are created or destroyed, \\nand the atoms themselves are not changed.\\n\\n2-5. dAlTon’S AToMIC ThEorY ExplAInS ThE lAW oF ConSTAnT CoMpoSITIon 51\\n\\nFigure 2.13 John Dalton (1766–1844) \\nwas born in England to a poor \\nQuaker family. He began teaching \\nat age twelve in a Quaker academy, \\nwhile continuing his own studies in \\nmathematics and natural philosophy. \\nHis attempts to earn his living as a \\npublic lecturer were not successful \\nbecause by all accounts he was a \\ndreadful speaker. Dalton’s first \\nscientific paper was on self-diagnosed \\ncolor blindness, still known as \\n“Daltonism.” His main scientific \\ninterest was meteorology, and he \\nkept a daily diary of his weather \\nobservations up to the day he died.  \\nHe presented his atomic theory \\nin lectures and publications using \\nwooden spheres to represent the \\nvarious elements, which helped the \\ntheory to become widely accepted  \\nby the scientific community. He  \\nwas awarded honorary degrees by \\nOxford University in 1832, and \\nEdinburgh University in 1834, \\nalthough he was not able to obtain  \\na position at any university because  \\nhe was a Quaker. \\n\\n\\n\\n2. AToMS And MolECulES52\\n\\nAs we shall see, some of these postulates were later modified, but the main fea-\\ntures of Dalton’s atomic theory still are accepted today.\\n\\nThe law of conservation of mass in chemical reactions follows directly from \\nDalton’s postulate that atoms are neither created nor destroyed in chemical re-\\nactions; rather, they are simply rearranged to form new substances. The law of \\nconstant composition follows from Dalton’s postulate that atoms are indivisible \\nand that compounds are formed by joining together different types of atoms. \\nThat is, compounds have constant composition because they contain fixed ratios \\nof the different types of atoms. For example, suppose it is found that calcium \\nsulfide is formed when calcium and sulfur are combined in a one-to-one ratio. \\nIn such a case, the ratio of calcium atoms to sulfur atoms is one-to-one, no mat-\\nter how the sample is prepared. The law of multiple proportions follows from \\nthe fact that some elements can combine to form more than one compound, \\nsuch as in the case of CO and CO2. Although Dalton’s application of his theory \\nwas marred by several incorrect guesses about the relative numbers of atoms in \\ncompounds (Figure 2.14), these errors were eventually resolved. Meanwhile, \\nthe atomic theory gained wide recognition and is now universally accepted.\\n\\nDalton’s atomic theory enables us to set up a scale of relative atomic masses. \\nConsider calcium sulfide, which we know consists of 55.6% calcium and 44.4% \\nsulfur by mass. Suppose there is one calcium atom for each sulfur atom in cal-\\ncium sulfide. Because we know that the mass of a calcium atom relative to that \\nof a sulfur atom must be the same as the mass percentages in calcium sulfide, \\nwe know that the ratio of the mass of a calcium atom to that of a sulfur atom is\\n\\n55.6\\n—\\n44.4\\n\\n= = 1.25\\nmass of a calcium atom\\n—\\nmass of a sulfur atom\\n\\nor\\n\\nmass of a calcium atom = 1.25 × (mass of a sulfur atom)\\n\\nThus, even though we cannot easily determine the mass of any individual \\natom, we can use the quantitative results of chemical analyses to determine the \\nrelative masses of atoms. Of course, we have based our result for calcium and \\nsulfur on the assumption that there is one atom of calcium for each atom of \\nsulfur in calcium sulfide.\\n\\nLet’s consider another compound, hydrogen chloride. Quantitative chemi-\\ncal analysis shows that the mass percentages of hydrogen and chlorine in hydro-\\ngen chloride are 2.76% and 97.24%, respectively. Once again, assuming (cor-\\nrectly, it turns out) that one atom of hydrogen is combined with one atom of \\nchlorine, we find that\\n\\n97.24\\n—\\n2.76\\n\\n= = 35.2\\nmass of a chlorine atom\\n—\\nmass of a hydrogen atom\\n\\nor\\n\\nmass of a chlorine atom = 35.2 × (mass of a hydrogen atom)\\n\\nBy continuing in this manner with other compounds, it is possible to build up \\na table of relative atomic masses. We define a quantity called the atomic\\tmass\\t\\n\\nFigure 2.14 Dalton’s symbols for \\nchemical elements. Some of these \\n“elements” are now known to be \\ncompounds, not elements (e.g., lime, \\nsoda, and potash). Some of Dalton’s \\natomic masses were in error because \\nof incorrect assumptions regarding \\nthe relative numbers of atoms in \\ncompounds.\\n\\n\\n\\nratio (usually referred to simply as the atomic\\tmass) as the ratio of the mass of a \\ngiven atom to the mass of some particular reference atom. At one time the mass \\nof hydrogen, the lightest atom, was arbitrarily given the value of exactly one and \\nused as the reference to which all other atomic masses were compared. As we \\npoint out in Chapter 11, however, a form of carbon is now used as the standard. \\nThus, today the atomic mass of hydrogen is 1.008 instead of exactly one. The \\npresently accepted atomic masses of the elements are given on the inside front \\ncover of the text.\\n\\nBecause “atomic masses” are actually ratios of masses, they have no units. \\nNevertheless, it is sometimes useful to assign to atomic masses a unit called the \\natomic\\tmass\\tunit. The atomic mass unit was once denoted by amu, but the sym-\\nbol u is now the symbol recommended by the International Union of Pure and \\nApplied Chemistry (IUPAC). In biochemistry, however, the unit dalton, with \\nthe symbol Da, is often used. Thus, we can say that the atomic mass of carbon is \\n12.01 or 12.01 u or 12.01 Da; all three statements are correct. Although we shall \\nrefer to atomic mass ratios for elements as simply atomic masses, it is important \\nto recognize that atomic masses are actually relative, dimensionless quantities. \\nThe particular values assigned to atomic masses (but not their ratios) depend \\non the reference atom chosen to set up the scale.\\n\\nExAMplE 2-2: Suppose the atomic mass of hydrogen were set at exactly \\none. Refer to the table of atomic masses on the inside front cover to calcu-\\nlate the atomic mass of carbon on the H = 1 scale.\\n\\nSolution: Because the ratio of the masses of two atoms is independent \\nof the value of the mass chosen for the reference element, we have in the \\npresent system\\n\\n12.0107\\n—\\n1.00794\\n\\n= = 11.9161\\nmass of C\\n—\\nmass of H\\n\\nThus, for the revised (H = 1 exactly) system, we would have\\n\\nmass of C\\n—\\n\\n1\\n= = 11.9161\\n\\nmass of C\\n—\\nmass of H\\n\\nand the atomic mass of carbon on the H = 1 scale would be 11.9161 rather \\nthan 12.0107.\\n\\nprACTICE problEM 2-2: Prior to the adoption of the present carbon-\\nbased scale of atomic mass, the atomic mass of oxygen was set equal to \\nexactly 16 and oxygen was used as the standard.

Molecules Are Groups of Atoms Joined Together\\nDalton postulated in the original version of his atomic theory that an element \\nis a substance consisting of identical atoms and that a compound is a substance \\nconsisting of molecules containing different kinds of atoms. Although Dalton \\ndid not realize it at the time, some of the elements occur naturally as molecules \\ncontaining more than one of the same kind of atoms. As we already noted in  \\nTable 2.5, the elements hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bro-\\nmine, and iodine exist as diatomic molecules of the same kind of atoms (see \\nFigure 2.4). Consequently, these substances are classified as elements. Com-\\npounds, on the other hand, are made up of molecules containing different \\nkinds of atoms. Examples of the chemical formulas for molecules of chemical \\ncompounds are as follows:\\n\\nH\\n\\nhydrogen\\nchloride, HCl\\n\\nwater, H2O\\n\\nCl H H\\n\\nO\\n\\nammonia, NH3\\n\\nH H\\n\\nN\\n\\nH\\n\\nmethane, CH4\\n(principal constituent \\n\\nof natural gas)\\n\\nH H\\n\\nH H\\nC\\n\\nmethanol, CH3OH\\n(methyl alcohol \\nor wood alcohol)\\n\\nCH HO\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nThese structural formulas indicate how the atoms are joined together in the \\nmolecules. The lines represent bonds between connected atoms. We shall learn \\nhow to write such formulas in Chapter 7. Scale models of these molecules are \\nshown in Figure 2.15.\\n\\nDalton’s atomic theory provides a microscopic view of chemical reactions. \\nRecall that Dalton proposed that, in a chemical reaction, atoms in the reactant \\nmolecules are separated and then rearranged into product molecules. Accord-\\ning to this view, the chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form \\nwater may be represented by the following rearrangement:\\n\\nNote that completely different molecules, and hence completely different sub-\\nstances, are formed in a chemical reaction. Hydrogen and oxygen are gases, \\nwhereas water is a liquid at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure. \\n      As another example, consider the burning of carbon in oxygen to form car-\\nbon dioxide, which may be expressed as follows:\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n05/13/09\\n\\n002-017\\n\\nx\\n\\nhydrogen chloride, HCl\\n\\nwater, H2O\\n\\nammonia, NH3 \\n\\nmethanol, CH3OH\\n\\nmethane, CH4\\n\\nFigure 2.15 Scale models \\nof molecules of hydrogen \\nchloride, water, ammonia, \\nmethanol, and methane.\\n\\nhydrogen, H2\\n\\nhydrogen, H2\\n\\noxygen, O2\\n\\nwater, H2O\\n\\nwater, H2O\\n\\n+\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n03/10/09\\n\\n001-020\\n\\ncarbon, C oxygen, O2 carbon dioxide, CO2\\n\\n+\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n03/10/09\\n\\n001-021\\n\\nElements are substances that \\nconsist of only one kind of \\natom (Fe, C, h2).

Compounds Are named by an orderly System  \\nof Chemical nomenclature\\n\\nThe system for the assignment of names to compounds is called chemical\\tno-\\nmenclature. Throughout this text as we encounter new classes of compounds, \\nwe shall learn the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) \\nrules for naming these compounds (and sometimes the older classical names \\nas well). These rules were developed to promote a single worldwide standard \\nfor chemical nomenclature and allow for fast and easy searching of literature \\nand databases for information regarding chemical compounds. Knowing these \\nrules will be of invaluable assistance to you throughout your study of science. \\nFor easy reference, a summary of the rules for naming the different classes of \\ncompounds presented in this text is given in Appendix C.\\n\\nIn this chapter we discuss only the system of naming compounds consist-\\ning of two elements, that is, binary\\tcompounds. When the two elements that \\nmake up a binary compound are a metal and a nonmetal that combine in only \\none fixed ratio, we name the compound by first writing the name of the metal \\nand then that of the nonmetal, with the ending of the name of the nonmetal \\nchanged to -ide. For example, we saw that the name of the compound formed \\nbetween calcium (a metal, Table 2.3) and sulfur (a nonmetal, Table 2.5) is cal-\\ncium sulfide. Because calcium sulfide consists of one atom of calcium for each \\natom of sulfur, we write the chemical\\tformula of calcium sulfide as CaS(s); in \\nother words, we simply join the chemical symbols of the two elements. In a dif-\\nferent case, calcium combines with two atoms of chlorine (a nonmetal) to form \\ncalcium chloride; thus, the formula of calcium chloride is CaCl2(s). Note that \\nthe number of atoms is indicated by a subscript. The subscript 2 in CaCl2(s) \\nmeans that there are two chlorine atoms per calcium atom in calcium chloride. \\nTable 2.6 lists the -ide nomenclature for some common nonmetals.\\n\\nExAMplE 2-3: Name the following binary compounds:\\n(a) K2O(s)   (b) AlBr3(s)   (c) CdSe(s)   (d) MgH2(s)\\n\\nSolution: Using Table 2.6 for the correct -ide nomenclature, we have\\n\\n2-7.

Because more than one binary compound may result from the combina-\\ntion of the same two nonmetallic elements, we distinguish the various possibili-\\nties by means of Greek numerical prefixes (Table 2.7). For example,\\n\\nCO(g ) carbon monoxide   CO2(g ) carbon dioxide\\n\\nSome other examples are\\n\\n SO2(g ) sulfur dioxide SO3(g ) sulfur trioxide\\n\\n SF4(g ) sulfur tetrafluoride SF6(g ) sulfur hexafluoride\\n\\n PCl3(l ) phosphorus trichloride PCl5(s) phosphorus pentachloride\\n\\nBall-and-stick models of these compounds are shown in Figure 2.16.\\n\\nNumber\\t Greek\\tprefix*\\t Example\\n\\n 1 mono- carbon monoxide, CO\\n\\n 2 di- carbon dioxide, CO2\\n\\n 3 tri- sulfur trioxide, SO3\\n\\n 4 tetra- carbon tetrachloride, CCl4\\n\\n 5 penta- phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5\\n\\n 6 hexa- sulfur hexafluoride, SF6\\n\\n 7 hepta-  \\n\\n 8 octa- \\n\\n 9 nona- \\n\\n 10 deca- \\n\\nTAblE 2.7 Greek prefixes used to indicate the \\nnumber of atoms of a given type in a molecule\\n\\n* The final a or o is dropped from the prefix when it is combined with a \\nname beginning with a vowel.\\n\\n(examples of compounds  \\nusing prefixes greater  \\nthan six will be given  \\nlater in the text)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen naming binary compounds the prefix mono- is not used for naming \\nthe first element and is generally dropped from the second; notable exceptions \\nare carbon monoxide and sometimes nitrogen monoxide. For example,\\n\\nNO(g)  nitrogen oxide or nitrogen monoxide\\n\\nCO(g)  carbon monoxide\\n\\nIn addition, as illustrated in the previous examples (and noted in the foot-\\nnote to Table 2.7), the final a or o is dropped from the prefix when it is com-\\nbined with a name beginning with a vowel. For example, penta + chloride is \\nwritten as pentachloride; but penta + iodide is changed to pentiodide (the a \\nin penta is dropped). Likewise, mono + hydride is written as monohydride; but \\nmono + oxide is changed to monoxide. This is not the case with the di- and tri- \\nprefixes; carbon dioxide and boron triiodide are both correct.\\n\\nHydrogen is another important exception: it can act as either a metal or non-\\nmetal. When hydrogen is listed first in a binary formula, it is generally treated as \\na metal and named accordingly; for example, H2S(g ), hydrogen sulfide. When \\nhydrogen is listed at the end of a binary formula, it is generally treated as a non-\\nmetal; for example, NaH(s), sodium hydride, and AsH3(s), arsenic trihydride.\\n\\nThe names of some additional compounds containing hydrogen that you \\nshould know are water, H2O(l ), ammonia, NH3(g ), and methane, CH4(g ).\\n\\nExAMplE 2-4: Name the following binary compounds:\\n(a) BrF5(l )  (b) XeF4(s)  (c) NH3(g)  (d) N2O4(g )  (e) HBr(g )\\n\\nSolution: Because these compounds involve two nonmetallic elements, we \\nmust denote the relative numbers of the two types of atoms in the name. \\n(a) Bromine is written first in the formula; thus we name the compound \\nbromine pentafluoride (the prefix mono - is usually omitted on the first \\nnamed element); (b) xenon tetrafluoride; (c) ammonia; (d) dinitrogen \\ntetroxide; (e) hydrogen bromide.\\n\\nprACTICE problEM 2-4: Name the following compounds:\\n(a) N2O(g)  (b) NO(g)  (c) N2O3(l )  (d) N2O5(g )  (e) NO2(g )\\n\\nAnswer:\\n(a) dinitrogen oxide, (b) nitrogen oxide (or nitrogen monoxide),  \\n(c) dinitrogen trioxide, (d) dinitrogen pentoxide, (e) nitrogen dioxide.\\n\\nThe compound dinitrogen oxide, N2O(g ), (common name, nitrous \\noxide) was the first known general anesthetic (laughing gas) and is still \\nsometimes used in dentistry.

Molecular Mass Is the Sum of the Atomic Masses  \\nof the Atoms in a Molecule\\n\\nNow that we can distinguish different compounds by their chemical formulas, \\nwe can make our explanation of the law of constant composition still clearer \\nand more useful by introducing the idea of molecular mass. The sum of the \\natomic masses of the atoms in a molecule is called the molecular\\tmass of the \\nsubstance. For example, a water molecule, H2O, consists of two atoms of hydro-\\ngen and one atom of oxygen. Using the table of atomic masses given on the \\ninside front cover, we see that the molecular mass of water is\\n\\nmolecular mass of H2O = 2 (atomic mass of H) + (atomic mass of O) \\n\\n= 2 (1.008) + (16.00) = 18.02\\n\\nto four significant figures. Similarly, using the table of atomic masses given on \\nthe inside front cover, we see that the molecular mass of dinitrogen pentoxide, \\nN2O5, is\\n\\nmolecular mass of N2O5 = 2 (atomic mass of N) + 5 (atomic mass of O) \\n\\n= 2 (14.01) + 5 (16.00) = 108.02\\n\\nThe following example shows how to use atomic and molecular masses to \\ncalculate the mass percentage composition of compounds.\\n\\nExAMplE 2-5: Using the fact that the atomic mass of lead is 207.2 and \\nthat of sulfur is 32.07, calculate the mass percentages of lead and sulfur in \\nthe compound lead sulfide, PbS(s).\\n\\nSolution: As the formula PbS(s) indicates, lead sulfide consists of one atom \\nof lead for each atom of sulfur. The molecular mass of lead sulfide is\\n\\nmolecular mass of lead sulfide =  atomic mass + atomic mass   \\n     of lead           of sulfur \\n\\n= 207.2 + 32.07 = 239.3\\n\\nThe mass percentages of lead and sulfur in lead sulfide are\\n\\natomic mass of lead\\n—\\nmolecular mass of lead sulfide\\n\\n= × 100mass percentage of lead\\n\\n207.2\\n—\\n239.3\\n\\n= × 100 = 86.59% \\n\\natomic mass of sulfur\\n—\\nmolecular mass of lead sulfide\\n\\n= × 100mass percentage of sulfur\\n\\n32.07\\n—\\n239.3\\n\\n= × 100 = 13.40% \\n\\n\\n\\nNote that this result is the same as that calculated in Example 2-1. The \\ntable of atomic masses must be consistent with experimental values of mass \\npercentages. The two mass percentages in this example do not add up to \\nexactly 100% because of a slight round-off error.\\n\\nprACTICE problEM 2-5: Calculate the mass percentages of bromine \\nand fluorine in BrF5(l ).\\n\\nAnswer: 45.687% Br and 54.313% F\\n\\nOne of the great advantages of Dalton’s atomic theory was that he was able \\nto use it to devise a table of atomic masses that could then be used in chemical \\ncalculations like those in Example 2-5. What Dalton did not know, however, is \\nthat not all atoms of a given element have the same atomic mass. This discovery, \\nwhich was made in the twentieth century, required a new model of the atom.\\n\\n2-9.  Most of the Mass of an Atom Is  \\nConcentrated in Its nucleus\\n\\nFor most of the nineteenth century, atoms were considered to be indivisible, \\nstable particles, as proposed by Dalton. Toward the end of the century, how-\\never, new experiments indicated that an atom is composed of even smaller sub-\\natomic\\tparticles.\\n\\nOne of the first experiments on subatomic particles was carried out by the \\nEnglish physicist J. J. Thomson in 1897 (Figure 2.17). Some years earlier, it had \\nbeen discovered that an electric discharge (glowing current) flows between me-\\ntallic electrodes that are sealed in a partially evacuated glass tube, as shown in  \\n\\n2-9. MoST oF ThE MASS oF An AToM IS ConCEnTrATEd In ITS nuClEuS 59\\n\\nFigure 2.17 English scientist Sir \\nJoseph John Thomson (1856–1940). \\nThomson’s work on cathode rays led \\nto the discovery of the electron in \\n1897. His later work with positive ion \\nbeams led to a method of separating \\natoms and molecules by mass and \\nthe discovery of neon. Thomson was \\nawarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in \\n1906 and was knighted in 1908. He is \\nburied in Westminster Abbey.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. AToMS And MolECulES60\\n\\nFigure 2.18. These glowing discharges were called cathode\\trays. Scientists knew \\nthat these rays were not caused by atoms or heavier particles because the mass \\nof the two plates in the apparatus remained constant. Much debate among \\nphysicists ensued over the nature of the rays. Using an apparatus of the type \\ndepicted in Figure 2.18, Thomson deflected the rays with electric and mag-\\nnetic fields and showed that they were actually streams of identical, negatively \\ncharged particles. He correctly reasoned that these particles, which are now \\ncalled electrons, are constituents of atoms. The electron was the first subatomic \\nparticle to be discovered.\\n\\nThomson’s discharge tube experiment along with later experiments \\nshowed that the mass of an electron is 9.109 × 10−31 kg and that its charge is \\n−1.602 × 10−19 C, where C is the symbol for coulomb, the SI unit of charge. It \\nis often convenient to express charges as multiples of 1.602 × 10−19 C. Thus the \\ncharge on an electron is −1 in this convention. The mass of an electron is only \\n1/1800 the mass of a hydrogen atom, confirming Thomson's assumption that \\nan electron is a subatomic particle.\\n\\nThomson's discharge tube was the forerunner of the cathode\\t ray\\t tube \\n(CRT) used widely in television and video monitors before the advent of the \\nliquid crystal display or LCD screen (see Section 15-12).\\n\\nIf an atom contains electrons, which are negatively charged particles, then \\nit also must contain positively charged particles because atoms are electrically \\nneutral. The total amount of negative charge in a neutral atom must be bal-\\nanced by an equal amount of positive charge. The question is: How are the \\npositively charged particles and electrons arranged within an atom?\\n\\nAbout the same time that Thomson discovered the electron, the French \\nscientist Antoine-Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity, the process by \\nwhich certain atoms spontaneously break apart. Becquerel showed that ura-\\nnium atoms are radioactive. Shortly after his discovery, Marie and Pierre Curie \\n(Frontispiece), working in Paris, discovered other radioactive elements such \\nas radium (so named because it emits rays) and polonium (named for Poland, \\nMarie Curie’s native country). Then in the early 1900s, the New Zealand–born \\nphysicist Ernest Rutherford (Figure 2.19) began to study radioactivity. He dis-\\ncovered that the radiation emitted by radioactive substances consists of three \\ntypes, which are now called a-particles (alpha particles), b-particles (beta par-\\n\\nElectrode\\n\\nElectrode\\n\\nElectron beam\\n\\nMagnetic\\ndeflection coils\\n\\nElectric\\ndeflection plates\\n\\n+\\n\\n–\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n02/19/10 \\n\\n002-021\\n\\nx\\n\\nFigure 2.18 Schematic of a discharge \\ntube.

Experiments by Rutherford and others showed \\nthat a-particles have a charge equal in magnitude to that of two electrons but \\nof opposite (i.e., positive) sign and a mass equal to the mass of a helium atom \\n(4.00 u); that b-particles are simply electrons that result from radioactive disin-\\ntegrations; and that g-rays are electromagnetic radiation similar to X-rays (see \\nChapter 4). Table 2.8 summarizes the properties of these three common emis-\\nsions from radioactive substances.\\n\\nRutherford became intrigued with the idea of using the newly discovered \\na-particles as subatomic projectiles. At the time Rutherford was working with \\nHans Geiger (who later developed the Geiger counter). In a now-famous  \\nexperiment, Ernest Marsden, a 20-year-old undergraduate student who was be-\\ning trained by Geiger, took a piece of gold and formed it into an extremely thin \\nfoil (gold is very malleable). He then directed a beam of a-particles at the gold \\nfoil and observed the paths of the a-particles by watching for flashes as they \\nstruck a fluorescent screen surrounding the foil (Figure 2.20).

Most \\nof the particles passed through the foil \\n(pathway a). Some were deflected only \\nslightly (pathway b) when they passed \\nnear a gold nucleus in the foil, and a \\nfew were deflected backward (pathway \\nc) when they collided with a nucleus.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. AToMS And MolECulES62\\n\\nformly throughout the atom, Rutherford and Marsden expected the tiny fast-\\nmoving alpha particles to tear through the foil. They assumed that the trajecto-\\nries of the a-particles would be altered only slightly (at most by two degrees).\\n\\nContrary to expectations, while most of the a-particles passed straight \\nthrough the foil, a few “bounced back,” being deflected through large angles \\n(pathway c in Figure 2.20). These results astounded Rutherford as he was to \\nrelate in a later lecture, “It was quite the most incredible event that ever hap-\\npened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell \\nat a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you!”\\n\\nRutherford interpreted this astonishing result to mean that all the positive \\ncharge and the bulk of the mass of an atom are concentrated in a very small \\nvolume at the center, which he called the nucleus (Figure 2.21). He named this \\nthe nuclear\\tmodel\\tof\\tthe\\tatom.\\n\\nBy counting the number of a-particles deflected in various directions, Ruth-\\nerford was able to show that the radius of a gold nucleus is about 1/100 000 of \\nthe radius of the atom. If the radius of the nucleus were the size of a golf ball, \\nthen the radius of the atom would be about 3000 meters (10 000 feet). Thus, \\nthe nucleus represents a very small fraction of the volume of an atom, as Figure \\n2.21 implies.\\n\\nThe positively charged particles found in the atomic nucleus are called pro-\\ntons. These subatomic particles have a positive charge equal in magnitude to \\nthat of an electron but opposite in sign. The mass of a proton is almost the same \\nas the mass of a hydrogen atom, about 1800 times the mass of an electron.\\n\\nThe electrons in an atom are located throughout the space surrounding the \\nnucleus (Figure 2.21). We shall discuss how the electrons are arranged in an \\natom in Chapters 4 and 5.\\n\\n2-10. Atoms Consist of protons, neutrons, and Electrons\\n\\nOur picture of the atom is not yet complete. Experiments suggested that the \\nmass of a nucleus cannot be attributed to the protons alone. Scientists hypoth-\\nesized in the 1920s, and in 1932 it was experimentally verified, that there is \\nanother type of particle in the nucleus. This particle has a slightly greater mass \\nthan a proton and is called a neutron because it is electrically neutral.\\n\\nThe modern picture of an atom, then, consists of three types of particles—\\nelectrons, protons, and neutrons. The properties of these three subatomic par-\\nticles are shown below.\\n\\nParticle Charge* Mass/u Located\\n\\nproton +1 1.007 276 47 in nucleus\\n\\nneutron 0 1.008 664 90 in nucleus\\n\\nelectron −1 5.485 7990 × 10−4 outside nucleus\\n\\n*Relative to the charge on a proton.

In other words, no two elements have the same atomic number. \\nFor example, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 (1 proton in the nucleus), \\nhelium has an atomic number of 2 (2 protons in the nucleus), and uranium has \\nan atomic number of 92 (92 protons in the nucleus). The table of the elements \\ngiven on the inside front cover of this book lists the atomic numbers of all the \\nknown elements. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called \\nthe mass\\tnumber of that atom and is denoted by A.\\n\\nExAMplE 2-6: Use the mass data given in the table above to calculate the \\npercentage of the mass of a hydrogen atom that is located in the nucleus. \\nAssume that the hydrogen nucleus consists of a single proton.\\n\\nSolution: The mass percentage in the nucleus of a hydrogen atom is given \\nby the ratio of the mass of a proton to the mass of a proton plus the mass  \\nof an electron multiplied by 100 to convert the result to a percentage:\\n\\n1.007 276 47\\n—\\n1.007 276 47 + 0.000 548 579 90\\n\\n× 100 = 99.945 5679%\\n\\nA hydrogen atom has a lower mass percentage in its nucleus than any  \\nother atom.\\n\\nprACTICE problEM 2-6: Given that the diameter of a nucleus is \\nroughly 1 × 10−5 times that of an atom, calculate the percentage by volume \\nof an atom that is occupied by the nucleus. (Hint: Recall that the volume \\nof a sphere is given by V = 4/3 pr 3.)\\n\\nAnswer: Roughly 1 × 10−13 % of the volume is occupied by the nucleus. \\nAn even smaller percentage is occupied by the electrons; the remainder  \\nis empty space.\\n\\n2-11. Most Elements occur in nature as Mixtures of Isotopes\\n\\nNuclei are made up of protons and neutrons, each of which has a mass of  \\napproximately 1 u; therefore, you might expect atomic masses to be approx- \\nimately equal to whole numbers. Although many atomic masses are ap- \\nproximately whole numbers (for example, the atomic mass of oxygen is 16.00 \\nand the atomic mass of fluorine is 19.00), many others are not. Chlorine  \\n(Z = 17) has an atomic mass of 35.45, magnesium (Z = 12) has an atomic mass \\nof 24.31, and copper (Z = 29) has an atomic mass of 63.55. The explanation \\nfor these variations lies in the fact that many elements consist of two or more \\nisotopes, which are atoms of one element that contain the same number of pro-\\ntons but different numbers of neutrons. Recall that it is the number of protons \\n(the atomic number) that characterizes a particular element, but nuclei of the \\nsame element may have different numbers of neutrons. For example, the most \\ncommon isotope of the simplest element, hydrogen, contains one proton and \\none electron, but no neutrons. Another less common isotope of hydrogen con-\\ntains one proton, one neutron, and one electron. These two hydrogen isotopes \\n\\n2-11.

The heavier isotope is called heavy \\nhydrogen—or, more commonly, deuterium—and is often denoted by the spe-\\ncial symbol D. Water that is made from deuterium is called heavy\\twater and is \\nusually denoted by D2O(l ).\\n\\nAn isotope is specified by its atomic number (Z ) and its mass number (A). \\nThe notation used to designate isotopes is the chemical symbol of the element \\nwritten with its atomic number as a left subscript and its mass number as a left \\nsuperscript:\\n\\nA\\nZX chemical symbol\\n\\nmass number\\n\\natomic number\\n\\nFor example, an ordinary hydrogen atom is denoted ¹¹H and a deuterium atom \\nis denoted ²¹H (or sometimes  ²¹D). The number of neutrons, N, in an atom is \\nequal to\\n\\nN = A − Z  (2.1)\\n\\nBecause all isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons, the \\natomic number (Z ) and the chemical symbol (X) are redundant. Consequently, \\nthe atomic number is often omitted. For example, the isotope of carbon used in \\nradiocarbon dating (containing six protons and eight neutrons) may be written \\nas  ¹46C, 14C, or carbon-14.\\n\\nExAMplE 2-7: Fill in the blanks.\\n\\nSymbol\\t Atomic\\tnumber\\t Number\\tof\\tneutrons\\t Mass\\tnumber\\n\\n (a) 22  48\\n\\n (b)  110 184\\n\\n (c)    ??Co   60\\n\\nSolution:\\n(a) The number of neutrons is the mass number minus the atomic number \\n(Equation 2.1), or 48 − 22 = 26 neutrons.

The symbol of the particular isotope is 6027Co, and the isotope has \\n60 − 27 = 33 neutrons.

Give the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in a neutral \\nphosphorous-32 atom.\\n\\nAnswer: 15, 17, 15, respectively\\n\\nAlthough one of the postulates of Dalton's atomic theory was that all the \\natoms of a given element have the same mass, we now see that this is not usu-\\nally so. Isotopes of the same element have different masses, but all atoms of a \\ngiven isotope have the same mass. Several common natural isotopes and their \\ncorresponding masses are given in Table 2.9. Note that the isotopic mass of  \\ncarbon-12 is exactly 12. The modern atomic mass scale is based on this conven-\\ntion.

In fact, we now \\nknow that an a-particle is simply the nucleus of a helium-4 isotope.\\n\\nAs Table 2.9 implies, many elements occur in nature as mixtures of isotopes. \\nThe naturally occurring percentages of the isotopes of a particular element \\nare referred to as the natural\\tabundances of that element. Naturally occurring \\nchlorine consists of two isotopes: 75.78% chlorine-35 and 24.22% chlorine-37. \\nThese percentages are nearly independent of the natural source of the chlo-\\nrine. In other words, chlorine obtained from, say, salt deposits in Africa or Aus-\\ntralia or North America has nearly the same isotopic composition as that given \\nin Table 2.9.\\n\\nThe mass and percentage of each isotope of an element can be determined \\nby using an instrument called a mass\\tspectrometer\\t(Figure 2.22). When a gas \\nconsisting of atoms is bombarded with electrons from an external source, the \\nbombarding electrons knock electrons out of the neutral atoms in the gas. A \\nneutral atom contains an equal number of positively charged protons (Z ) and \\nnegatively charged electrons. An atom or molecule that gains or loses one or \\nmore electrons becomes charged and is called an ion. These gas-phase ions are \\naccelerated by an electric field and pass through slits to form a narrow, well-\\nfocused beam (Figure 2.23). The beam of ions then passes through an electric \\nor magnetic field that deflects each ion by an amount proportional to its mass. \\nThus, the original beam of ions splits into several separate beams, one for each \\nisotope of the gas. The intensities of the separated ion beams, which can be \\ndetermined experimentally, are a direct measure of the number of ions in each \\nbeam. In this manner, we can determine not only the mass of each isotope of \\nany element (by the amount of deflection of each beam) but also the percentage \\nof each isotope (by the intensity of each beam). Also note that the mass spec-\\ntrometer separates the mixture of isotopes into isotopically pure components; \\ntherefore, we can use it to prepare isotopically pure samples of elements.\\n\\nThe atomic mass of chlorine is the sum of the masses of each isotope, each \\nmultiplied by its natural abundance. This is called a weighted\\taverage. Using \\nthe isotopic masses and natural abundances of chlorine given in Table 2.9, we \\nobtain\\n\\nFigure 2.22 A mass spectrometer like \\nthe one shown here can be used to \\nseparate the isotopes of an element.  \\nIn addition to determining the mass of \\nisotopes, mass spectrometers are also \\na powerful tool for chemical analysis. \\nThe mass spectrometer shown here is \\nused by students to check for traces of \\ncocaine on U.S. currency.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis value is the atomic mass of chlorine given on the inside front cover of \\nthe book. Note the number of significant figures obtained from the separate \\nmultiplication and addition steps involved in this calculation. The factors \\n(75.78/100) and (24.22/100) must be included in order to take into account \\nthe relative natural abundance of each isotope. Thus, tables of atomic masses \\nof the elements contain the relative average masses of atoms.

Ions Are Charged particles\\n\\nAs we saw in the previous section, an atom or molecule with a charge due to the \\nloss or gain of one or more electrons is called an ion. Positively charged ions are \\ncalled cations; and negatively charged ions are called anions. We will encoun-\\nter ions throughout our study of chemistry, so we introduce a notation for them \\nhere. An atom that has lost one electron has a net charge of +1; an atom that \\nhas lost two electrons has a charge of +2; an atom that has gained an electron \\nhas a charge of −1; and so on. We denote an ion by the chemical symbol of the \\nelement with a right-hand superscript to indicate its charge:\\n\\nK+ singly charged potassium ion\\n\\nMg2+ doubly charged magnesium ion\\n\\nCl− singly charged chloride ion\\n\\nS2− doubly charged sulfide ion\\n\\n\\n\\nA neutral potassium atom has 19 protons and 19 electrons and a neutral chlo-\\nrine atom has 17 protons and 17 electrons. A K+ ion has 18 electrons (19 − 1 = \\n18), and a Cl− ion also has 18 electrons (17 + 1 = 18). Species that contain the \\nsame number of electrons are said to be isoelectronic.\\n\\nThe names of cations are simply the element name plus the word ion or cat-\\nion. Anions are given an -ide ending (like the second-named element in binary \\ncompounds) plus the word ion or anion. For example,\\n\\nCa2+ calcium ion or calcium cation\\n\\nH− hydride ion or hydride anion\\n\\nWe should mention that when writing out the name of an ion, we do not \\nalways indicate that the ion is “singly charged” or “doubly charged” when its \\ncharge is obvious from the context.\\n\\nExAMplE 2-9: How many electrons are there in a Mg2+ cation and a \\nS2− anion?\\n\\nSolution: From the table on the inside of the front cover, we see that the \\natomic number of magnesium is 12. A Mg2+ ion is a magnesium atom that \\nhas lost two electrons, so a Mg2+ ion has 10 electrons. The atomic number \\nof sulfur is 16. The S2− ion has two more electrons than a neutral sulfur \\natom, so a S2− ion has 18 electrons.\\n\\nprACTICE problEM 2-9: Give an example of a cation that is isoelec-\\ntronic with the oxide ion, O2−.\\n\\nAnswer: Na+, Mg2+, Al3+.\\n\\nExAMplE 2-10: Write the symbol for the element that has 8 protons, \\n10 neutrons, and 10 electrons.\\n\\nSolution: ¹88O2–.

Dalton was able to use the atomic theory to \\ndetermine the relative masses of atoms and molecules and to use these values \\nin interpreting the results of chemical analyses. According to the atomic theory, \\nthe atoms in reactant molecules are separated and rearranged into product \\nmolecules in a chemical reaction. Because atoms are neither created nor de-\\nstroyed in chemical reactions, chemical reactions obey the law of conservation \\nof mass.\\n\\nElements are substances that consist of only one kind of atom. There are al-\\nmost 120 known elements, about three-quarters of which are metals. Elements \\ncombine chemically to form compounds, whose constituent particles are called \\nmolecules, which are groups of atoms joined together. Chemists represent ele-\\nments by chemical symbols and compounds by chemical formulas. The system \\nof naming compounds is called chemical nomenclature.\\n\\nChemicals can exist as solids, liquids, or gases. We denote these states of \\nmatter by attaching the symbols (s), (l ), or (g ) to the chemical formula of a sub-\\nstance. Many of the substances found in nature exist as mixtures. Separation \\ntechniques such as filtration, evaporation, and distillation are used in chemis-\\ntry to obtain pure substances from mixtures.\\n\\nProtons and neutrons are found in the nucleus of an atom, the small center \\ncontaining all the positive charge and essentially all the mass of the atom. The \\nnumber of protons in an atom is the atomic number (Z ) of that atom. The total \\nnumber of protons and neutrons in an atom is the mass number (A) of that \\natom.\\n\\nEach element is characterized by its atomic number. Nuclei with the same \\nnumber of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. \\nMost elements occur naturally as mixtures of isotopes, and atomic masses are \\nweighted averages of the isotopic masses. Because isotopes of an element have \\nthe same atomic number, they are chemically identical and they undergo the \\nsame chemical reactions.\\n\\nWhen an atom or molecule gains or loses electrons, it becomes charged and \\nis called an ion. Positively charged ions are called cations; negatively charged \\nions, anions. Cations have a positive charge that is equal in magnitude to the \\nnumber of electrons lost and anions have a negative charge that is equal in mag-\\nnitude to the number of electrons gained. Two species with the same number of \\nelectrons are said to be isoelectronic.\\n\\nIn this chapter we have established the fundamental concepts of atoms and \\nmolecules.

He started his studies at the St. Petersburg Pedagogical Institute and, after \\nstudying for several years at various laboratories in Europe, returned to St. Petersburg \\nto earn his doctorate. In 1863, at the age of 33, he was appointed as a professor of \\nchemistry at the University of St. Petersburg. In 1869, he published the first version \\nof his periodic table in his textbook Principles of Chemistry. In addition to his great \\nachievement with the periodic table, he was involved in the early development of \\nthe extensive oil fields at Baku, helping to create the first Russian oil refinery, was \\na founding member of the Russian Chemical Society, developed and patented the \\nstandard formula for Russian vodka, and is credited with bringing the metric system  \\nto Russia.\\n\\nMendeleev had a prickly personality and often quarreled with his first wife,  \\nFeozva Leshceva. In 1882, he divorced her in order to marry his niece’s best friend,  \\nthe young Anna Ivanova Popova, with whom he stayed happily married. In his later \\nyears, Mendeleev grew notorious for his lack of concern over his personal appearance. \\nIt is said that he cut his hair and beard only once a year and even refused to trim them \\nfor the Czar.\\n\\nThroughout his life, Mendeleev worked to abolish social inequity and became an \\noutspoken critic of the Russian government. Because of his participation in student \\nprotests, he was forced to resign from the university in 1890. His last lecture was broken \\nup by police fearing riots.\\n\\n\\n\\n79\\n\\n3.   The Periodic Table and  \\nChemical Periodicity\\n\\nLavoisier and Dalton opened the way to a systematic exploration of pure     substances and their properties. With the new tools of atomic mass, atomic \\nnumber, and quantitative measurement, scientists could probe the vast variety \\nof chemical behavior. Their studies, and our studies, are made easier because \\nmany elements share common characteristics. Instead of looking separately at \\neach element and its compounds, we can separate the elements into groups and \\nstudy the reactions of each group. In addition, when we arrange the elements in \\norder of increasing atomic number, we find a repetitive order in their chemical \\nproperties. This arrangement, known as the periodic table, will be the basis for \\nunderstanding the chemistry of the elements throughout this book and in your \\nfuture studies. We begin this chapter by looking at some simple chemical reac-\\ntions and how we express these using a notation called a chemical equation. In \\nlater chapters, as we learn more about the properties of atoms and molecules, \\nwe shall see why certain chemicals react to form new compounds and why oth-\\ners do not.\\n\\n3-1. New Substances Are Formed in Chemical Reactions\\nLet’s begin with some of the simplest chemical reactions, those in which a metal \\nreacts directly with a nonmetal. For example, consider the reaction between \\nsodium and chlorine. Sodium is a very reactive metal. It reacts spontaneously \\nwith the oxygen and water vapor in the air and is usually stored under kerosene, \\nan oily liquid that is unreactive in the absence of sparks or flames. Chlorine, a \\nnonmetal, is a greenish-yellow, highly reactive, toxic gas that attacks many met-\\nals. When sodium metal is dropped into a container of chlorine gas, there is a \\nvigorous, spontaneous reaction. The product of the reaction is a white, crystal-\\nline solid—sodium chloride—which is ordinary table salt. We can represent the \\nreaction of sodium with chlorine as\\n\\n sodium metal    +    chlorine gas     →    sodium chloride (3.1)\\n very reactive metal       very reactive nonmetal       nonreactive compound\\n     (ordinary table salt)\\n\\n 3-1 Chemical Reactions\\n\\n 3-2 Chemical Equations\\n\\n 3-3 Group Properties\\n\\n 3-4 Periodicity\\n\\n 3-5 Groups of Elements\\n\\n 3-6 Classification of Elements\\n\\n 3-7 Periodic Trends\\n\\n\\n\\n3. The PeRIoDIC TAble AND CheMICAl PeRIoDICITy80\\n\\nEquation 3.1 illustrates the fact that the chemical properties of a product of \\na chemical reaction need not bear any resemblance to the chemical properties \\nof the reactants (Figure 3.1). Entirely new substances are formed in chemical \\nreactions.\\n\\nAnother example of the differences between reactants and products is \\nfound in the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water. Both hydro-\\ngen and oxygen are colorless, odorless gases. Together they form an explosive \\nmixture that is set off easily by a spark or a flame. The reaction between hydro-\\ngen and oxygen can be described by the equation\\n\\nhydrogen gas    +    oxygen gas   →        water (3.2)\\n         colorless gas  colorless gas             colorless liquid\\n\\nThe properties of water are radically different from those of either hydro-\\ngen or oxygen. Because hydrogen is the least dense gas, being about 15 times \\nless dense than air, balloons and dirigibles used to be filled with hydrogen. \\nThis practice was discontinued after 1937, when the hydrogen-filled German \\ndirigible Hindenburg exploded at Lakehurst, New Jersey (Figure 3.2). Modern \\nblimps and weather balloons are filled with helium gas, which is nonreactive \\nand about seven times less dense than air.\\n\\nIt is cumbersome to write out the full names of the reactants and products of \\nchemical reactions as we have been doing. Consequently, chemists have devised \\na shorthand way of describing the chemical changes that occur in chemical \\nreactions. A chemical reaction is represented by a chemical equation that de-\\nnotes the reactants and the products in terms of their chemical formulas. The \\nreactants are the substances that react with each other, and the products are \\nthe substances formed in the reaction. A left-to-right arrow is used to indicate \\n\\nFigure 3.1 When sodium (a very \\nreactive metal) reacts with chlorine \\ngas (a very reactive nonmetal), \\nthe product is sodium chloride \\n(ordinary table salt). Note that the \\nproduct is an entirely new substance \\nand is chemically and physically \\ndifferent from both reactants.\\n\\nFigure 3.2 The explosion of the \\nhydrogen gas-filled German dirigible \\nHindenburg during landing at \\nLakehurst, New Jersey.\\n\\n\\n\\n3-2. A CheMICAl equATIoN MuST be bAlANCeD 81\\n\\nthat the reactants are converted to products. For example, the reaction between \\nsodium metal and chlorine gas to form sodium chloride is expressed by\\n\\n Na(s) + Cl2(g) → NaCl(s) (not balanced) (3.3)\\n\\nThe plus sign on the left-hand side of this equation means “reacts with.” \\nThe arrow separates the reactants from the products and means “to yield” or “to \\nproduce.” The arrow also shows the direction in which the reaction proceeds. \\nRecall that the symbol (s) after a chemical formula tells us that the substance is \\na solid and the symbol (g) tells us that the substance is a gas. All substances in \\nelemental form are represented simply by the symbol of the element (e.g., Na) \\nin chemical equations. The subscript 2 following the element chlorine (Cl2) \\nin Equation 3.3 indicates that there are two atoms of chlorine in its molecular \\nformula—recall from Chapter 2 that chlorine is one of the naturally occurring \\ndiatomic elements. At this point in your study the formulas of all the reactants \\nand products will be given; in later chapters you will learn to use chemical prin-\\nciples to predict the products of some of the more common chemical reactions \\nyourself.\\n\\nThe representation of a chemical reaction by the chemical formulas of the \\nreactants and products separated by an arrow, as we have done above, is called \\na chemical equation. Equation 3.3 still omits an essential feature of chemical \\nequations; that is, the number of chlorine atoms is not the same on both the \\nleft (reactant) and the right (product) sides. A systematic procedure for balanc-\\ning simple chemical equations is presented in the next section. This will be \\nexpanded to include more complex equations in later chapters.\\n\\n3-2. A Chemical equation Must be balanced\\nDalton’s atomic theory showed that Lavoisier’s law of conservation of mass in \\nchemical reactions is a direct result of the conservation of each type of atom in-\\nvolved in the chemical reaction. Although new substances are formed in chemi-\\ncal reactions as a result of new arrangements of the atoms, the individual atoms of \\nvarious types are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Thus, the number \\nof atoms of each element remains the same in a chemical reaction. Consequen-\\ntially, a complete chemical equation must always be balanced; that is, it must \\nhave the same number of each type of atom on both sides. Note that Equation \\n3.3 contains two atoms of chlorine on the left but only one atom of chlorine on \\nthe right. We can balance Equation 3.3 with respect to the chlorine atoms by \\nplacing a 2 in front of the NaCl(s) on the right-hand side of the equation:\\n\\nNa(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)  (not balanced)\\n\\nNow there are two sodium atoms on the right but only one on the left. If we \\nplace a 2 in front of the Na(s) on the left, then we obtain\\n\\n 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)  (balanced) (3.4)\\n\\nEquation 3.4 is a balanced chemical equation for the reaction of sodium \\nwith chlorine; both sides contain the same number of each kind of atom.\\n\\nWe balance chemical equations by placing the appropriate numbers, called \\n\\n\\n\\n3. The PeRIoDIC TAble AND CheMICAl PeRIoDICITy82\\n\\nbalancing coefficients, in front of the chemical formulas. The chemical formu-\\nlas of the reactants and products themselves are fixed. They cannot be altered. \\nIf a subscript is changed, the formula is incorrect. We cannot balance Equation \\n3.3 by changing NaCl to NaCl2. The chemical formula of sodium chloride is \\nNaCl, not NaCl2. In fact, no such compound as NaCl2 exists.\\n\\nNote that it is conventional to omit the number 1 when writing chemical for-\\nmulas and equations. It would be unconventional to express Equation 3.4 as\\n\\n2 Na1(s) + 1 Cl2(g ) → 2 Na1Cl1(s)  (unconventional )\\n\\nLet’s consider now the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen. Recall that hy-\\ndrogen and oxygen exist as diatomic molecules. We first write Equation 3.2 in \\nterms of the chemical formulas of the reactants and products, that is,\\n\\nH2(g ) + O2(g ) → H2O(l )     (not balanced)\\n\\nwhere the (l ) after the formula of water means that it is a liquid. In this equa-\\ntion, there are two oxygen atoms on the left in O2(g) and one oxygen atom on \\nthe right in H2O(l ). If we place a 2 in front of the H2O(l ), then the equation is \\nbalanced with respect to oxygen atoms:\\n\\nH2(g ) + O2(g ) → 2 H2O(l )  (not balanced)\\n\\nNow there are four hydrogen atoms on the right (2 × 2) and only two on the \\nleft. We balance the hydrogen atoms by placing a 2 in front of the H2(g):\\n\\n                          2 H2(g ) + O2(g ) → 2 H2O(l )       (balanced)\\n\\nThis gives us the balanced equation for the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen \\n(Figure 3.3). The balanced chemical equation can be expressed in words as fol-\\nlows: two molecules of hydrogen react with one molecule of oxygen to yield two \\nmolecules of water. Once again, note that a chemical equation is balanced by \\nplacing coefficients in front of the formulas of the reactants and products; the \\nformulas themselves are not altered.\\n\\nThe method that we used to balance the chemical equations in the two \\nexamples above is called the method of balancing by inspection. The essence \\nof this method is to adjust the coefficients of the chemical formulas on each \\nside of the arrow such that the number of atoms of every element involved is \\nexactly the same on both sides of the equation. The procedure is summarized \\nas follows:\\n\\n 1.   Write down the chemical formulas of the reactants and products. Separate \\nthe reactants from the products by an arrow and the individual reactants \\nand products using plus (+) signs.\\n\\n 2.   Look for elements that appear only once on each side of the equation, \\nincluding any subscripts, and adjust the balancing coefficients so that the \\nnumber of atoms of the element on both sides is the same.\\n\\n 3.  Inspect the remaining elements in turn and balance them as needed.\\n 4.   Perform a final check of each element in your chemical equation to be \\n\\nsure that every element is balanced.\\n\\nFigure 3.3 A representation using \\nmolecular models of the reaction \\nbetween hydrogen and oxygen to \\nform water.

Examining Equation 3.5 we see \\nthat sodium appears once on both sides in Na and NaOH. Because both \\ncontain only one atom of sodium, no adjustment to the coefficients is neces-\\nsary. However, should we need to change either of these coefficients later, \\nwe must also change the other to maintain this equality.

Because there are two hydrogen atoms on the left \\nside of the equation but three on the right, we need to adjust the coeffi-\\ncients.

There is \\nanother way to balance chemical equations that might appeal to you if \\nyou like algebra. Consider the (unbalanced) equation in Example 3-1. \\nLet’s write it as\\n\\na Na + b H2O → c NaOH + d H2\\n\\nwhere a through d  are to be determined. If we balance the sodium atoms, \\nthen we must have\\n\\n a = c (Na atoms balance)\\n\\nThe hydrogen and oxygen atoms give us\\n\\n2b = c + 2d  (H atoms balance)\\n\\n b = c (O atoms balance)\\n\\nThere are three equations and four unknowns. The balancing coef-\\nficients are relative quantities, so we may set any one of them equal to \\nwhatever we wish. Let’s set a = 1. Then, the first equation gives c = 1, the \\nthird gives b = 1, and the second gives 2 = 1 + 2d, or d = 1_2 . Thus, the bal-\\nanced equation is\\n\\nNa(s) + H2O(l ) → NaOH(aq) +    H2(g )\\n\\nor\\n\\n2 Na(s) + 2 H2O(l ) → 2 NaOH(aq) + H2(g )\\n\\nThis method will always work, although the set of algebraic equations \\nfor the balancing coefficients can be fairly large. We simply present this \\nmethod for you as an alternative to the method of balancing by inspection \\nif you like to work with algebraic equations.\\n\\n1_\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a little practice, you can become proficient in balancing certain types \\nof chemical equations by inspection. Problems 3-1 through 3-8 at the end of \\nthis chapter will give you the practice you need.\\n\\nWe should emphasize here that a chemical equation is a representation of a \\nchemical reaction. It is somewhat arbitrary how we choose to write a chemical \\nequation. Sometimes you will see chemical equations like Equation 3.4,\\n\\n 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s) \\n\\nwritten as\\n\\n   Na(s) + 1_2 Cl2(g) → NaCl(s) (3.6)\\n\\nOf course, we do not mean to imply by this equation that one atom of sodium \\nreacts with half a molecule of chlorine to give one unit of sodium chloride. The \\nbalancing coefficients lend themselves to many interpretations. For example, \\nwe could interpret the balancing coefficients to be dozens if we wished. In this \\ncase we would read Equation 3.6 as one dozen sodium atoms reacts with half \\na dozen chlorine molecules to give one dozen sodium chloride units. In Chap-\\nter 11 we’re going to learn about a convenient unit called a mole (you may or \\nmay not remember about moles from high school chemistry). Using this unit, \\nwe could interpret Equation 3.6 as one mole of sodium reacts with one-half \\nmole of chlorine to give one mole of sodium chloride. All these interpretations \\nare equally valid. You may use whichever one is most convenient for you at the \\ntime. Because the interpretation of balancing coefficients is so arbitrary, they \\ndo not have units. Strictly speaking, they simply represent the relative values of \\nthe quantities (be they atoms, or molecules, or whatever) in the equation.\\n\\nAll these considerations emphasize that a chemical equation is a represen-\\ntation of a chemical reaction. Sometimes chemists refer to a chemical equa-\\ntion such as Equations 3.4 or 3.6 as a chemical reaction, but this is somewhat \\ncareless. A chemical reaction is a chemical event that occurs in nature, and a \\nchemical equation is simply a convenient way for chemists to represent that  \\nreaction.\\n\\n3-3.  elements Can be Grouped According to Their  \\nChemical Properties\\n\\nBy the 1860s, more than 60 elements had been discovered, and many chemists \\nhad begun to notice patterns in the chemical properties of certain elements. \\nFor example, consider the three metals lithium, Li(s), sodium, Na(s), and potas-\\nsium, K(s). All three of these metals are less dense than water (Figure 3.4), are \\nsoft enough to be cut with a knife (Figure 3.5), have fairly low melting points \\n(below 200ºC), and are very reactive. In fact, they all react spontaneously with \\noxygen and water. Just as sodium reacts vigorously with chlorine, so do lithium \\nand potassium, as described by the chemical equations\\n\\n2 Li(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 LiCl(s)\\n\\n2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s)\\n\\n2 K(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 KCl(s)\\n\\n3-3. eleMeNTS CAN be GRouPeD ACCoRDING To CheMICAl PRoPeRTIeS 85\\n\\nFigure 3.4 The alkali metals lithium, \\nsodium, and potassium are less \\ndense than water. Lithium floats on \\noil, which floats on water.\\n\\n\\n\\n3. The PeRIoDIC TAble AND CheMICAl PeRIoDICITy86\\n\\nThe product in all three cases is a white, unreactive, crystalline, ionic solid (i.e., \\na solid composed of ions) that dissolves readily in water, and melts at high tem-\\nperatures.\\n\\nExample 3-1 shows the chemical equation for the reaction of sodium with \\nwater to produce sodium hydroxide, NaOH(s), and hydrogen. Lithium and po-\\ntassium (Figure 3.6, top) undergo similar reactions, as described by the equa-\\ntions\\n\\n2 Li(s) + 2 H2O(l ) → 2 LiOH(aq) + H2(g )\\n\\n2 K(s) + 2 H2O(l ) → 2 KOH(aq) + H2(g )\\n\\nJust like sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, LiOH(s), and potassium hydrox-\\nide, KOH(s), are water-soluble, corrosive, white, translucent solids. \\n\\nLithium, sodium, and potassium have similar chemical properties and can \\nbe considered as a group. Because the hydroxides of these metals are alkaline, \\nthat is, they form corrosive aqueous solutions that feel slippery (like soap solu-\\ntions) and react with acids (see Section 10-3), they are called alkali metals. The \\nterm alkali comes from an Arabic word meaning “the ash” and refers to the fact \\nthat sodium and potassium were discovered in the ashes left from the combus-\\ntion of plants.\\n\\nThe members of other groups of elements also share similar chemical prop-\\nerties. For example, magnesium, Mg(s), calcium, Ca(s), strontium, Sr(s), and \\nbarium, Ba(s), have many chemical properties in common. As a group, these \\nmetals are called the alkaline-earth metals because their compounds often oc-\\ncur in alkaline soil deposits. When heated, these metals all burn brightly in \\noxygen to form white, crystalline, ionic oxides. The reaction of magnesium with \\noxygen is shown in Figure 3.7. These reactions may be described in terms of \\nequations as\\n\\n2 Mg(s) + O2(g ) → 2 MgO(s)\\n\\n2 Ca(s) + O2(g ) → 2 CaO(s)\\n\\nFigure 3.5 The alkali metals are soft. \\nSodium can be cut with a pocketknife.\\n\\nFigure 3.6 Reactions of the alkali \\nmetal potassium and the alkaline- \\nearth metal calcium with water.  \\n(top) Potassium reacts violently with \\nwater to produce potassium hydroxide \\nand hydrogen gas.

We see, \\nthen, that these four metals have similar chemical properties and can be placed \\ninto a group, just as lithium, sodium, and potassium can.\\n\\neXAMPle 3-2: Given that magnesium reacts with sulfur to form magne-\\nsium sulfide, MgS(s), write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction \\nbetween calcium and sulfur.\\n\\nSolution: The chemical equation for the reaction of Mg(s) with S(s) is\\n\\nMg(s) + S(s) → MgS(s)\\n magnesium sulfide  \\n\\nTherefore, by analogy, we predict\\n\\nCa(s) + S(s) → CaS(s)\\n calcium sulfide\\n\\nwhich is correct.\\n\\nPRACTICe PRobleM 3-2: Given that calcium reacts with chlorine to \\nform CaCl2(s), predict the product of the reaction between strontium and \\nchlorine and write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction.\\n\\nAnswer: Sr(s) + Cl2(g) → SrCl2(s)\\n\\nAnother group of elements having similar chemical properties consists of \\nthe nonmetals fluorine, F2(g), chlorine, Cl2(g), bromine, Br2(l ), and iodine, \\nI2(s), (Figure 3.8). As we noted in Chapter 2, these elements exist as diatomic \\nmolecules. All four elements are very reactive; that is, they react with most met-\\nals and nonmetals. As a group, they are called halogens, a Greek word meaning \\n“salt formers.” The halogens react with the alkali metals to give white, crystal-\\nline, ionic solids called halides. The specific names of the halides are fluoride, \\nchloride, bromide, and iodide. For example, in the case of sodium we have\\n\\n 2 Na(s) + F2(g) → 2 NaF(s) sodium fluoride\\n\\n 2 Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 NaCl(s) sodium chloride\\n\\n 2 Na(s) + Br2(l ) → 2 NaBr(s) sodium bromide\\n\\n 2 Na(s) + I2(s) → 2 NaI(s) sodium iodide\\n\\n3-3. eleMeNTS CAN be GRouPeD ACCoRDING To CheMICAl PRoPeRTIeS 87\\n\\nFigure 3.7 Magnesium ribbon burns \\nrapidly in oxygen to form magnesium \\noxide, a white solid.

The elements Show a Periodic Pattern When listed  \\nin order of Increasing Atomic Number\\n\\nThroughout the history of chemistry many attempts have been made to find pat-\\nterns and to classify the elements. After Dalton proposed his atomic theory, the \\nconcept of atomic mass and the experimental determination of atomic masses \\ntook on increasing importance. In the middle of the nineteenth century, many \\nchemists discovered various trends related to the masses of the elements, but \\nmost of these early classification systems had significant shortcomings. How-\\never, in 1869 a table put forth by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (Fron-\\ntispiece) began to gain acceptance and gradually evolved into our modern peri-\\nodic table. A brief history of the development of the periodic table is presented \\nin Interchapter B.\\n\\nMendeleev arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic mass and \\nwas able to show that the chemical properties of the elements exhibit repetitive \\npatterns in chemical behavior. To illustrate the idea of Mendeleev’s observa-\\ntion, let’s start with the element lithium and arrange the succeeding elements \\nin order of increasing atomic mass, as shown in Table 3.1. If we examine Table \\n3.1 carefully, then we see that the chemical properties of the elements show a \\nremarkably repetitive, or periodic, pattern. The variations in the properties of \\nthe elements increasing in atomic number from lithium to neon are repeated \\nin the properties of the elements from sodium to argon. The repeating pattern \\n\\nFigure 3.9 The reaction of \\naluminum metal with bromine to \\nform aluminum bromide, AlBr3(s).\\n\\nSee Interchapter B at  \\nwww.McQuarrieGeneralChemistry.com.\\n\\n\\n\\n3-4.

This placement of sodium \\nleads, by continuation of the listing by atomic mass order, to the placement of \\nMg below Be and Cl below F (Cl2 and F2 have similar chemical behaviors). Men-\\ndeleev did not know about the existence of the noble gases (see Section 3-5). He \\nthen began a new period by placing K in the same group as Na and Li, because \\nK is similar to Na in chemical behavior. He continued, listing the elements in \\n\\n Atomic mass Element Symbol Properties Formula of element Formula of halide*\\n\\n 6.9 lithium Li very reactive metal Li LiX\\n\\n 9.0 beryllium Be reactive metal Be BeX2\\n\\n 10.8 boron B semimetal† B BX3\\n\\n 12.0 carbon C nonmetallic solid C CX4\\n\\n 14.0 nitrogen N nonmetallic diatomic gas N2 NX3\\n\\n 16.0 oxygen O nonmetallic, moderately  O2 OX2\\n    reactive diatomic gas\\n\\n 19.0 fluorine F very reactive diatomic gas F2 FX\\n\\n 20.2 neon Ne very unreactive Ne none\\n    monatomic gas\\n\\n 23.0 sodium Na very reactive metal Na NaX\\n\\n 24.3 magnesium Mg reactive metal Mg MgX2\\n\\n 27.0 aluminum Al metal Al AlX3\\n\\n 28.1 silicon Si semimetal† Si SiX4\\n\\n 31.0 phosphorus P nonmetallic solid P PX3\\n\\n 32.1 sulfur S nonmetallic solid S SX2\\n\\n 35.5 chlorine Cl very reactive diatomic gas Cl2 ClX\\n\\n 39.9 argon Ar very unreactive monatomic gas Ar none\\n\\nTAble 3.1 The chemical properties of 16 elements, listed in order of increasing atomic mass\\n\\n*X stands for F, Cl, Br, or I.\\n\\n† Boron and silicon are called semimetals because they have properties that are intermediate between those of the metals and \\nthose of the nonmetals.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.

His genius lay in the periodic arrangement of the ele-\\nments by atomic mass and in his realization that apparent gaps in the periodic \\narrangement, that is, in the periodicity, must correspond to missing elements. \\nHe used the concept of periodicity to predict many of the chemical and physical \\nproperties of these, at that time unknown, elements.\\n\\nFigure 3.10 presents a modern version of the periodic table of the elements. \\nThis version is more complicated than the version with which we began because \\nit contains more elements than just the 16 listed in Table 3.1, and many more \\nelements than were known to Mendeleev. In the modern periodic table in Fig-\\nure 3.10, the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number in-\\nstead of increasing atomic mass. With a few exceptions, the order is the same in \\nboth cases. The idea of atomic number was not developed until the early 1900s, \\nabout 40 years after Mendeleev’s first periodic table was published.\\n\\n3-5.  elements Assigned to the Same Column in the Periodic Table \\nhave Similar Chemical Properties\\n\\nNotice in Figure 3.10 that lithium, sodium, and potassium occur in the left-\\nmost column of the periodic table.

These include the alkali metals \\n(Interchapter D), main group metals \\n(Interchapter I), halogens (Interchapter \\nq), and noble gases (Interchapter K).  \\nThese can be found at  \\nwww.McquarrieGeneralChemistry.com. \\n\\n\\n\\nother substances. By analogy with the chemical equations describing reactions \\nof sodium that we discussed earlier, we predict that, for example,\\n\\n2 Rb(s) + Cl2(g) → 2 RbCl(s)\\n\\n2 Cs(s) + 2 H2O(l ) → 2 CsOH(s) + H2(g )\\n\\nOther reactions of rubidium and cesium also are similar to those of lithium, \\nsodium, and potassium.\\n\\neXAMPle 3-4: Predict the product of the reaction between beryllium \\nand oxygen.\\n\\nSolution: Because beryllium, like calcium, is an alkaline-earth metal, \\nwe predict that BeO(s) is the reaction product, analogous to CaO(s). \\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction is\\n\\n2 Be(s) + O2(g) → 2 BeO(s)\\n\\nPRACTICe PRobleM 3-4: Write a balanced chemical equation to \\ndescribe the reaction between rubidium and water.\\n\\nAnswer: 2 Rb(s) + 2 H2O(l ) → 2 RbOH(aq) + H2(g )\\n\\nElements assigned to the same column of the periodic table are said to be-\\nlong to the same group or family. The leftmost column in the periodic table is \\nlabeled 1, so the elements in that column are referred to as the Group 1 metals \\n(Interchapter D). As noted previously, the Group 1 metals are also called the al-\\nkali metals. The metals in the column labeled 2 are called the Group 2 metals, \\nor the alkaline earth metals. Every element in Groups 1 and 2 is a reactive metal \\nand undergoes chemical reactions similar to those of the other members of its \\nrespective group. At this stage we will regard the group numbers as identifica-\\ntion devices. Later we will see that the group numbers have further significance \\nin terms of the arrangement of the electrons in the atoms.\\n\\nElements in the same column in the rest of the periodic table also share \\nsimilar chemical properties. This similarity is particularly strong in Groups 1–2 \\nand 13–18, the main-group elements (Interchapter I). The halogens, which \\nwe know behave similarly, occur in Group 17 (Interchapter Q). The rightmost \\ncolumn of the periodic table (Group 18) contains the noble gases, which are \\ncharacterized primarily by their relative lack of chemical reactivity (Figure \\n3.12). Prior to 1962, they often were called the inert gases because  no  com-\\npounds of these gases were known. In 1962, however, xenon was shown to form \\ncompounds with fluorine and oxygen, the most reactive nonmetals. Krypton \\nfluorides are also known, but no stable compounds of helium, neon, or argon \\nare yet known. The noble-gas elements are the least reactive group of elements \\nin the periodic table (Interchapter K).\\n\\nBecause the elements in a given group have similar chemical properties, the \\nsimple compounds of the elements from that group usually have similar chemi-\\ncal formulas. This relation can be seen in Table 3.2, which shows the known \\nbinary hydrides of the main-group elements, shown in red in Figure 3.10.\\n\\n3-5.

White phosphorus, P4(s), spontaneously bursts into \\nflame in the presence of oxygen to produce the oxide P4O6(s). Use the \\nperiodic table to predict the reaction between yellow arsenic, As4(s), and \\noxygen.\\n\\nSolution: Arsenic occurs in the same group (Group 15) as phosphorus, so \\nwe predict, by analogy with phosphorus, that As4(s) reacts with oxygen to \\nproduce As4O6(s). The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is\\n\\nAs4(s) + 3 O2(g ) → As4O6(s)\\n\\nArsenic compounds are well known to be poisonous, the lethal dose of \\nAs4O6(s) being about 0.1 grams for an average adult. However, very small \\namounts of arsenic compounds may be beneficial or even necessary.

For example, in 1869 \\nthe element following zinc in order of atomic mass was arsenic. Yet Mendeleev’s \\nconcept of periodicity led him to place arsenic in Group 15 rather than in \\nGroup 13 or 14 because its chemical behavior was similar to that of phosphorus. \\nHe then boldly proposed that there were two, as yet undiscovered, elements to \\nfill the gaps this left between zinc and arsenic. Mendeleev accurately predicted \\nmany of the properties of these elements prior to their discovery (see Interchap-\\nter B). Table 3.3 compares Mendeleev’s 1869 predictions with the actual proper-\\nties of the element gallium (atomic number 31), which was not discovered until \\n1875. Gallium has an unusually low melting point for a metal (30ºC) and melts \\nwhen held in the hand (Figure 3.13).\\n\\nThe periodic table is the most useful concept in chemistry. Almost every gen-\\neral chemistry classroom and laboratory in the world has a periodic table hang-\\ning on the wall. You may have noticed that the periodic table hanging in your \\nclassroom or laboratory is slightly different from the one given in Figure 3.10.  \\n\\nTAble 3.2 The binary hydrides of the main-group elements\\n\\n LiH BeH2 BH3 CH4 NH3 H2O HF\\n\\n NaH MgH2 AlH3 SiH4 PH3 H2S HCl\\n\\n KH CaH2 GaH3 GeH4 AsH3 H2Se HBr\\n\\n RbH SrH2 InH3 SnH4 SbH3 H2Te HI\\n\\n CsH BaH2 TlH3 PbH4 BiH3  \\n\\nTAble 3.3 Comparison of Mendeleev’s \\npredictions and actual experimental \\nvalues for the properties of gallium\\n\\n Property Predicted Observed\\n\\n atomic mass 69 69.7\\n\\n density/g·cm–3 6.0 5.9\\n\\n melting point  low 30ºC\\n\\n boiling point high 2400ºC\\n\\n formula of oxide M2O3  Ga2O3\\n\\nSee Interchapter B at  \\nwww.McQuarrieGeneralChemistry.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nA more common version of the periodic table is shown in Figure 3.14. The ma-\\njor difference between Figure 3.10 and Figure 3.14 involves the treatment of ele-\\nments 57 through 71—collectively called the lanthanide series—and elements \\n89 through 103—called the actinide series. These elements have been removed \\nfrom the normal numerical sequence of elements and placed at the bottom of the \\ntable. This change produces a more compact (short-form) periodic table. Some \\nversions of the periodic table place lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac) in the ta-\\nble and place elements 58 through 71 (cerium through lutetium) and elements \\n90 through 103 (thorium through lawrencium) below. In addition, many versions \\nhave different headings for the columns. Older versions of the periodic table \\nlabel the six rightmost groups as 3A through 8A and the transition metals as 3B, \\n4B, and so on. These differences are not important and are no cause for concern.\\n\\nThe periodic table contains all the known chemical elements and shows the \\nperiodic relationships among them.

In this version, currently recommended by IUPAC, the lanthanide series \\n(elements 57 through 71) and the actinide series (elements 89 through 103) have been placed at the bottom of the table for \\ntwo reasons. First, the separation leads to a more compact table. Second, and more important, all the elements in each of \\nthese two series have exceptionally similar chemical properties. The number under the symbol for each element is the atomic \\nmass.

The nonmetals are on the right side and are separated from \\nthe metals by a zigzag line. As might be expected, the elements on the border \\nbetween metals and nonmetals (light green elements in Figure 3.15) have prop-\\nerties that are intermediate between those of metals and those of nonmetals. \\nSuch elements, called semimetals (or metalloids), are brittle, semilustrous sol-\\nids (Figure 3.16). Because semimetals do not conduct electricity and heat as well \\nas metals do—but better than nonmetals do—they are called semiconductors. \\nThe semimetals silicon and germanium are widely used in the manufacture of \\nsemiconducting devices, transistors, and integrated circuits.\\n\\nContrasting properties of the metals, the semimetals, and the nonmetals \\nare given in Table 3.4. The metallic character of the elements, in the sense of \\ntheir reactivity with nonmetals, increases as we move down a column in the \\nperiodic table and as we move from right to left in a row of the periodic table \\n(Figure 3.17). Thus, francium is the most metallic element and fluorine is the \\nmost nonmetallic element. The noble gases (Group 18) are nonmetals, but they \\nare so unreactive that with the exception of xenon, and to a lesser extent kryp-\\nton, they do not form compounds. The transition from metallic to semimetallic \\nto nonmetallic behavior as we move from left to right across the periodic table is \\nnot sharp; rather, there is a gradual change in properties of the main-group ele-\\nments from distinctly metallic (Group 1) to distinctly nonmetallic (Group 17).\\n\\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 181\\n\\nLanthanide series\\n\\nActinide series\\n\\nFigure 3.16 The semimetals (or \\nmetalloids) are brittle solids.

Unlike \\nthe main-group elements, the transition metals within any row have similar \\nchemical properties. Many of the transition metals are probably familiar to \\nyou (Figure 3.18). Iron, nickel, chromium, copper, tungsten, and titanium are \\nwidely used in alloys for structural materials and play a key role in the world’s \\ntechnology. The precious metals—gold, platinum, and silver—are used as hard \\ncurrency, in jewelry, and in high-quality electronic circuits. The transition met-\\nals vary greatly in abundance. Iron and titanium are plentiful, whereas rhenium \\n(Re) and hafnium (Hf) are rare.\\n\\nThe properties of the transition metals vary from group to group; yet they \\nall are characterized by high densities and high melting points. In addition, \\nunlike the compounds of the Group 1 and Group 2 metals, many compounds \\nof the transition metals are colored. The metals with the greatest densities—\\niridium, Ir(s), 22.65 g·cm–3, and osmium, Os(s), 22.61 g·cm–3—and the highest \\nmelting point—tungsten (W), 3410ºC—are transition metals.\\n\\nThe elements in the lanthanide series and the actinide series—the two \\nseries that begin with lanthanum (Z = 57) and actinium (Z = 89) in Figure \\n\\n3-6.

Some versions of the periodic table place hydro-\\ngen in both groups; others list it separately from the table. Hydrogen is not a \\nmetal like the Group 1 metals; yet it forms many compounds whose formulas \\nare similar to those of the Group 1 metal compounds. For example, we have\\n\\n HCl(g) hydrogen chloride and  NaCl(s) sodium chloride\\n\\n H2S(g) hydrogen sulfide and  Na2S(s) sodium sulfide\\n\\nHowever, sodium chloride and sodium sulfide are white, crystalline solids, \\nwhereas hydrogen chloride and hydrogen sulfide are suffocating, toxic gases.\\n\\nHydrogen is a diatomic gas like the halogens and forms many compounds \\nwith formulas similar to those of halogen compounds:\\n\\n3-7.

The PeRIoDIC TAble AND CheMICAl PeRIoDICITy98\\n\\nNaH(s) sodium hydride and NaCl(s) sodium chloride\\n\\nNH3(g ) ammonia and NCl3(l ) nitrogen trichloride\\n\\nThis analogy is superficial, however. Even though the formulas may be simi-\\nlar, the chemical and physical properties of these pairs of compounds are very \\ndifferent. For example, NaH(s) reacts vigorously with water to produce hydro-\\ngen gas and sodium hydroxide, whereas NaCl(s) simply dissolves in water.\\n\\nPerhaps most important is the difference in the properties of the first mem-\\nber of a group from those of the other members. Even in Group 1, which is a \\nrelatively homogeneous group, we find that lithium differs in a number of ways \\nfrom the other members of the group. For example, most salts of sodium, potas-\\nsium, rubidium, and cesium are soluble in water, but many lithium salts are only \\nsparingly soluble. Lithium reacts directly with nitrogen at room temperature, \\nbut the other Group 1 metals react with nitrogen only at temperatures above \\n500ºC. The chemical properties of beryllium are different from those of mag-\\nnesium; and boron (a semimetal) is quite different from aluminum. The Group \\n15 elements phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth react directly with \\nchlorine (Figure 3.21), according to the chemical equations\\n\\n2 P(s) + 3 Cl2(g ) → 2 PCl3(l )\\n\\n2 As(s) + 3 Cl2(g ) → 2 AsCl3(l )\\n\\n2 Sb(s) + 3 Cl2(g ) → 2 SbCl3(s)\\n\\n2 Bi(s) + 3 Cl2(g ) → 2 BiCl3(s)\\n\\nbut nitrogen does not. The most striking example of this difference, however, \\noccurs in Group 14, where the chemistry of carbon is significantly different \\nfrom that of the other Group 14 elements. In fact, the chemistry of carbon is so \\ndiverse that an entire subfield of chemistry, called organic chemistry, is devoted \\nto it (see Interchapters F, G, and H). Carbon atoms bonded together form the \\nbackbones of innumerable, extremely complex molecules that can each involve \\nthousands of atoms. In chemistry we refer to compounds containing carbon as \\norganic compounds. The chemistry of the other Group 14 elements is not as \\ndiverse as that of carbon.\\n\\nSurprising similarities exist in reactivity between the first element in a group \\nand the second element in the following group, for example, between lithium \\nand magnesium, beryllium and aluminum, and boron and silicon. These simi-\\nlarities are referred to as diagonal relationships, because of the relative loca-\\ntions of these pairs of elements in the periodic table (Figure 3.22). As we shall \\nsee in Chapter 5, the diagonal relationships are due in part to a similarity in the \\nsizes of the ions in each of the diagonal pairs of elements (e.g., Li+ and Mg2+ are \\nsimilar in size, as are Be2+ and Al3+).\\n\\nAlthough Mendeleev’s organization of the table was based purely on chemi-\\ncal knowledge, as we shall see in the next two chapters, the periodic trends \\nhe observed are based on a fundamental repeating pattern in the electronic \\nstructure of the atoms.\\n\\n1\\nH\\n\\n3\\nLi\\n\\n11\\nNa\\n\\n4\\nBe\\n\\n12\\nMg\\n\\n13\\nAl\\n\\n14\\nSi\\n\\n15\\nP\\n\\n16\\nS\\n\\n17\\nCl\\n\\n18\\nAr\\n\\n5\\nB\\n\\n6\\nC\\n\\n7\\nN\\n\\n8\\nO\\n\\n9\\nF\\n\\n10\\nNe\\n\\n2\\nHe\\n\\nFigure 3.22 Diagonal relationships \\namong the elements in the periodic \\ntable.

His father was a distinguished physiologist. \\nIn 1911, Bohr received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Copenhagen. He then spent a year with \\nJ. J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford in England, where he formulated his theory of the hydrogen atom \\nand its atomic spectrum. In 1913, he returned to the University of Copenhagen. In 1920, he was named \\ndirector of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University, which was supported largely by the Carlsberg \\nBrewery. The institute was an international center for theoretical physics during the 1920s and 30s, when \\nquantum theory was being developed. Almost every scientist who was active in the development of quantum \\ntheory worked at Bohr’s institute at one time or another. In 1943, because the Germans planned to arrest \\nhim to force him to work on their atomic bomb project, Bohr and his family fled to England under great \\nsecrecy and spent the remaining war years in the United States, where he participated in the Manhattan \\nProject at Los Alamos. After World War II, Bohr worked energetically for peaceful uses of atomic energy. He \\norganized the first Atoms for Peace Conference in 1955 and received the first Atoms for Peace prize in 1957. \\nBohr was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1922 “for his investigation of the structure of atoms and of \\nthe radiation emanating from them.”\\n\\n“The Father of Quantum Theory” Max Planck (1858–1948), right, was born in Kiel, Germany (then Prussia), \\nwhere his father was a law professor. Planck was a slow, focused, methodical thinker. He was often surprised \\nthat others could pursue several lines of intellectual work simultaneously. He began his studies at the \\nUniversity of Munich and received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1879 for his dissertation on the second \\nlaw of thermodynamics. He joined the faculty of the University of Kiel in 1885, and in 1888, was appointed \\ndirector of the Institute of Theoretical Physics, which was formed for him, at the University of Berlin. Planck \\nwas president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, later renamed the Max Planck Society, from 1930 until 1937, \\nwhen he was forced to retire by the Nazi government. Planck’s personal life was clouded by tragedy. His two \\ndaughters died in childbirth, one son died in World War I, and another son was executed in World War II for \\nhis part in the attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944. Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 \\n“in recognition of services he rendered to the advancement of physics by his discovery of energy quanta.”\\n\\n\\n\\n105\\n\\n4. Early Quantum Theory\\n\\nWhy do some atoms join together to form molecules and others do not? Why do the chemical and physical properties of the elements vary, and \\nwhat accounts for the periodic repetition of these properties, as seen in the pe-\\nriodic table? To answer these and other fundamental questions in chemistry, we \\nmust learn how electrons are arranged around the nucleus of an atom. Recall \\nthat our picture of an atom is a small, massive central nucleus containing all the \\npositive charge of the atom and essentially all the mass with electrons distrib-\\nuted about the nucleus in some sort of diffuse manner. The distribution of the \\nelectrons is described by quantum theory.\\n\\nQuantum theory, as we shall use it here, evolved slowly in two phases over \\na period of time from about 1900 to 1930. The first phase, which occurred \\nfrom 1900 to 1925, was stimulated by a number of experiments that could not \\nbe explained by the theoretical models of the time. Attempts to explain these \\nexperiments led to a very different view of the behavior of matter and light than \\nhad existed before. In this chapter we shall describe some of these experiments \\nand then discuss the attempts to explain them. We shall see that particles can \\ndisplay wavelike behavior and that waves can display particle-like behavior and \\nthat the energies of electrons in an atom are restricted to certain discrete val-\\nues that are characteristic of the atom. We shall then utilize this information to \\nexplain the spectra associated with atomic systems. In the next chapter, we shall \\ndiscuss the development of quantum theory from 1925 onward, which is used \\ntoday to understand the structure of atoms and molecules.\\n\\n4-1.  First Ionization Energy Is One of Many Periodic Properties  \\nof the Elements\\n\\nThe periodic table offers a great deal of insight into the electronic structure, or \\nelectron arrangements, of atoms. For example, in Chapter 3 we learned that, in \\ngeneral, elements in the same column in the periodic table are similar chemi-\\ncally. So we might expect that their outermost, and hence most chemically im-\\nportant, electrons have similar arrangements.\\n\\nA direct indication of the arrangement of electrons about a nucleus is given \\nby the ionization energies of the atom or ion. The ionization energy of an atom \\nor an ion is the minimum energy required to remove an electron completely \\nfrom the gaseous atom or ion.

Thus, we expect and find that I1 < I2 < I3 \\n< I4, and so forth, for any given gaseous atom.\\n\\nWhen we plot the first ionization energies of the elements against atomic \\nnumber, we find that there is a periodic pattern in these data (Figure 4.1). \\nNote that the noble gases have relatively large first ionization energies; in other \\nwords, it is relatively difficult to remove electrons from noble-gas atoms. This \\nobservation suggests that the electronic structures of the noble-gas atoms are \\nmore stable than those of the elements that precede and follow them in the \\nperiodic table. Furthermore, the alkali metals have relatively low ionization en-\\nergies (Figure 4.1), in accord with their extremely reactive nature. Thus, we see \\nthat ionization energies as well as chemical properties display a periodic char-\\nacter because both depend on electronic structure.

Early QuaNTuM ThEOry108\\n\\nWe can use the data in Table 4.1 to learn a lot about how electrons ar-\\nrange themselves in atoms. Let’s look at a helium atom. The first ionization \\nenergy of a helium atom (3.94 aJ) is much greater than that of a hydrogen atom  \\n(2.18 aJ) or a lithium atom (0.86 aJ), an observation that suggests the extraor-\\ndinary stability of a helium atom. The second ionization energy of a helium \\natom, in other words, the energy required to remove the second electron, is \\neven higher (8.72 aJ), being more than twice as large as the first. Realize, how-\\never, that here we are removing an electron from a positively charged He+ ion, \\nso we should expect I2 to be greater than I1 because of the electrical attraction \\nbetween the positively charged ion and the negatively charged electron we are \\nremoving.\\n\\nFigure 4.3 shows a plot of the energy required to remove the nth electron, \\nIn, against n for a lithium atom. (We actually plot the logarithm of the energy, \\nln (In/aJ), against n to compress the range of the vertical axis and produce a \\ntidier graph. We divide the values of In by 1 aJ here so that In/aJ is unitless; you \\ncan take logarithms of only unitless quantities.) Note that this figure suggests \\nthat the first electron is much easier to remove than the second one. From the \\nvalues given in Table 4.1, we see that the difference between the first and sec-\\nond ionization energies for a lithium atom (I2 − I1) is 11.2 aJ. This value is quite \\na bit larger than we might expect on the basis that we are simply removing the \\nsecond electron from a Li+(g) ion. For example, the difference between the first \\nand second ionization energies for a helium atom is only 4.78 aJ.\\n\\nLet’s make a similar graph for the Group 2 metal beryllium (Figure 4.4). \\nIn this case, it appears that the first two electrons are relatively easily removed, \\nleaving a core of two electrons that are much more tightly bound. The large \\nenergy difference between the two sets of electrons suggests that the four elec-\\ntrons in a beryllium atom are arranged such that two of them are more easily \\ndetached, and hence more chemically active, whereas the other two constitute \\na relatively stable, helium-like inner core. We call these two sets of electrons \\nshells. Thus, Figure 4.4 suggests that the electrons in a beryllium atom are ar-\\nranged in two distinct shells.\\n\\nEXaMPlE 4-2: Use the data in Table 4.1 for a carbon atom to plot \\nln(In/aJ) versus the number of electrons removed, n, as done in Figure 4.3 \\nand Figure 4.4.\\n\\nSolution: We make the following table:\\n\\nn In/aJ ln(In/aJ)\\n\\n 1 1.81 0.593\\n\\n 2 3.90 1.36\\n\\n 3 7.67 2.04\\n\\n 4 10.3 2.33\\n\\n 5 62.8 4.14\\n\\n 6 78.5 4.36\\n\\nIn\\n (\\n\\nI n\\n/a\\n\\nJ)\\n\\n321\\nn\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n07/30/09\\n\\n004-003\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\n–1\\n\\nx\\n\\n42\\n\\n3\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\n0 n\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n07/30/09\\n004-004\\n\\nx\\n\\nIn\\n (\\n\\nI n\\n/a\\n\\nJ)\\n\\nFigure 4.3 The logarithms of the \\nthree successive ionization energies \\n(ln In/aJ) of a lithium atom versus \\nthe number of electrons removed \\n(n).

Note that fluorine is in the seventh posi-\\ntion in the second row of the periodic table.\\n\\nIf we continue making these kinds of plots for each of the elements in the \\nsecond row of the periodic table through neon (Figure 4.5), we see that the \\nelectrons in these elements fall into two sets: an inner helium-like core of two \\nrelatively tightly bound electrons and an outer shell consisting of one through \\neight electrons for the elements lithium through neon. For each of these plots \\nthe number of electrons in the outer shell corresponds to the position of the \\nelement in the periodic table.\\n\\nThe atoms of the elements sodium through argon in the third row of the \\nperiodic table show a pattern similar to those of the second row, but for sodium \\nthrough argon it appears that the inner-core electronic structure is more like \\nthat of a neon atom than that of a helium atom. For example, Figure 4.6 sug-\\ngests that the electronic structure of a sodium atom is a neonlike core with a \\nrelatively loosely bound outer electron. Recall from Chapter 3 that sodium is a \\nhighly reactive element in the alkali metal family of the periodic table, whereas \\nneon is an unreactive element in the noble-gas family. It turns out that elements \\nlike neon that have a completely full outer electron shell are particularly stable \\nand unreactive. As we shall see, each of the elements in the noble-gas family \\nof the periodic table has a completely full outer electron shell, thus explaining \\ntheir relative inertness compared with other elements.

In the case of a \\npotassium atom, the electronic structure is a noble-gas (argon) core with one \\nrelatively loosely bound electron. Thus, the electronic structure of a potassium \\natom consists of four shells: an inner shell containing two electrons, a second \\nshell containing eight electrons, a third shell containing eight electrons, and a \\nfourth and outer shell containing just one electron, which is an argon-like core \\nwith one outer electron.\\n\\nWe can summarize these ideas by presenting the atoms as shown in Table \\n4.2. In the second column, we indicate the noble-gas-like core by using the sym-\\nbol for the gas enclosed in brackets; the outer-shell electrons are indicated by \\nthe dots. These electrons in the outermost occupied shell of an atom are also \\ncalled valence electrons. Thus, for example, we represent beryllium by a helium-\\nlike inner core with two valence electrons outside this core; the placement of \\nthe dots is arbitrary. As we shall see, the valence electrons play the dominant \\nrole in chemical bonding.\\n\\nThe third column in Table 4.2 is an abbreviated version of the second col-\\numn. Only the valence electrons are indicated, and the appropriate noble-gas \\ncore is understood. The number of valence electrons increases from one to \\neight as we go from alkali metal to noble gas across a row of main-group ele-\\nments in the periodic table. This pattern repeats itself from row to row. It is the \\nvalence electrons that play the key role in determining the chemical proper-\\nties of the elements; thus, fluorine and chlorine, for example, are chemically \\nsimilar because they both have seven valence electrons. The representation of \\nvalence electrons as dots around the symbol for an element is called a Lewis \\nelectron-dot formula; it was introduced in 1916 by G. N.

Many experiments sup-\\nported one viewpoint or the other; but toward the end of the nineteenth cen-\\ntury, most evidence favored a wave picture of electromagnetic radiation.\\n\\nIn the 1860s the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell developed the elec-\\ntromagnetic theory of radiation. This theory states that all forms of radiation \\nare propagated through space as oscillating electric and magnetic fields (Fig-\\nure 4.9). The electric and magnetic fields, which oscillate together but at right \\nangles to each other, arise from vibrating electric charges in a material, such as \\na quartz crystal in a radio transmitter or a hot tungsten filament in an incan-\\ndescent light bulb.\\n\\nFigure 4.10 depicts a simplified version of electromagnetic waves.

Although the wavelength is \\nthe distance per cycle and the frequency is the number of cycles per second, the \\nterm cycle is understood; so we omit it when the units of l and n are given.

The human eye is sensitive to this region \\nof the electromagnetic spectrum, and we call it the visible region (Figure 4.12). \\nThe short-wavelength end of the visible region (400 nm) is violet, and the long-\\nwavelength end (750 nm) is red.\\n\\nThe spectrum of white light has no gaps in it; we call it a continuous spec-\\ntrum, meaning that radiation is emitted at all wavelengths in the region. Yet, \\nif we use a prism to examine radiation emitted from a chemical sample placed \\nin a flame or a gas through which an electric spark is passed (such as that \\nfrom sodium lamps used as street lights or from hydrogen gas lamps), then we \\nfind that the radiation emitted is not continuous but consists of separate lines \\n(Figure 4.13). This observation suggests that the radiation is emitted at only \\ncertain (discrete) wavelengths. We call this type of spectrum a line spectrum. \\nA line spectrum is characteristic of the particular sample used. If the sample \\nconsists of individual atoms, then we call the emitted spectrum an atomic emis-\\nsion spectrum. The simplest atomic emission spectrum is that of the hydrogen \\natom.

Thus, the line spec-\\ntrum associated with an element serves as a fingerprint for that element. \\n\\nThe study of the spectral lines, or, more generally, the study of the interac-\\ntion of electromagnetic radiation and atoms, is called atomic spectroscopy. We \\ncan identify each type of atom present in a sample by comparing the observed \\nline spectrum with those in a handbook or a database of atomic spectra. Atomic \\nspectroscopy is a standard tool in analytical chemistry, the part of chemistry \\ninvolved with chemical analysis. Atomic spectroscopy is used in archaeology, art \\npreservation, astronomy, criminal investigations, environmental science, medi-\\ncine, and many other fields.\\n\\n4-5.  Electromagnetic radiation can Be viewed  \\nas a Beam of Photons\\n\\nIf light has a continuous spectrum, then how can the discrete spectral lines in \\natomic spectra be explained? Atomic spectra were only the first of many experi-\\nmental results that were impossible to interpret within the framework of the \\nphysics of the late nineteenth century, a theoretical framework now called clas-\\nsical physics. The theoretical analysis of these experiments stimulated some \\nradically new ideas about the nature of matter and energy that have had pro-\\nfound effects in science. These ideas led to a new general theory of atomic struc-\\nture that is in excellent agreement with our picture of the electronic structure \\nof atoms and with the periodic properties of the elements.\\n\\nThe first person to break with the ideas of classical physics was the German \\nphysicist, Max Planck (Frontispiece), in his study of blackbody radiation, the \\nemission of light from a heated body. All solid objects at temperatures greater \\nthan zero kelvin emit thermal radiation. The term blackbody is used to dis-\\ntinguish the object as an ideal radiator. The radiation from such an object \\ndepends only on its temperature and not its specific composition. It happens \\nthat a good emitter of radiation is also a good absorber. An ideal emitter will \\nabsorb all radiation incident upon it and will thus appear black. As a metal, for \\nexample, is heated to increasingly high temperatures, the color of the glowing \\nmetal changes continuously from red to white; this behavior is the origin of \\nthe terms red hot and white hot.

Thus, a hot object, such as an incandescent light bulb \\nfilament, would give off not only visible light, but also significant quantities of \\nultraviolet radiation, x-rays, and so forth, in contradiction to what is actually ob-\\nserved. With revolutionary insight, Planck proposed that the radiation is emit-\\nted in discrete packets, called quanta (singular, quantum), and that the energy \\nassociated with a quantum of radiation is proportional to the frequency of the \\nemitted radiation. In terms of an equation, Planck proposed that,\\n\\n E = hn (4.3)\\n\\nwhere E is the energy of a quantum of radiation, n is the frequency of the radia-\\ntion, and h is a proportionality constant, now called the Planck constant. Planck \\nwas able to reproduce all the data on blackbody radiation by assigning h the \\nvalue of 6.626 × 10−34 J·s.\\n\\nPlanck’s hypothesis explains why a metal object gives off red light when it \\nfirst begins to glow and then glows white hot as it reaches higher temperatures. \\n\\nFigure 4.16 Atomic spectra.

Early QuaNTuM ThEOry118\\n\\nRed light has the lowest frequency of visible radiation. Because the energy of \\na quantum of radiation is proportional to the frequency of the radiation, red \\nlight carries the smallest amount of energy within the visible spectrum. Thus, \\nwhen an object is just hot enough to glow, much of the light it radiates corre-\\nsponds to the lowest energy form of visible radiation. As the object becomes hot-\\nter, it emits more light at higher frequencies, while still emitting light at lower \\nfrequencies. Because all colors of visible light are now being emitted, the glow-\\ning object appears white. Moreover, in contrast to the prediction of classical \\nphysics, Planck’s hypothesis predicts a fall-off in the intensity of the radiation at \\nhigher frequencies that matches experimental observations.\\n\\nPlanck’s theory of blackbody radiation, with its unconventional assumption \\nthat a heated body emits radiation only in small discrete packets, was considered \\nlittle more than a curiosity, despite its success in interpreting the experimental \\ndata on blackbody radiation. Most scientists believed that in time a more satis-\\nfactory, which is to say classical, theory of blackbody radiation would emerge. \\nThis was not to be, however. \\n\\nAnother phenomenon that classical physics was unable to explain was the \\nphotoelectric effect. In the 1880s, it was discovered that electrons are ejected \\nfrom the surfaces of certain metals when they are exposed to ultraviolet radia-\\ntion. Figure 4.17 shows an apparatus for measuring the photoelectric effect and \\nFigure 4.18 shows some typical experimental data. Radiation of low frequency, \\nno matter how intense, does not eject any electrons whatsoever from the metal \\nsurface. As the frequency of the incident radiation is increased, however, a fre-\\nquency is reached beyond which electrons are now ejected. The value of this \\nminimum frequency, called the threshold frequency, depends upon the metal. \\nAt frequencies higher than the threshold frequency, electrons are ejected from \\nthe surface of the metal. At these frequencies, the kinetic energy of the ejected \\nelectrons increases in direct proportion to the frequency of the radiation. In \\naddition, an increase in the intensity of the radiation increases the number of \\nelectrons emitted but does not affect their energies.\\n\\nLike the experiments on blackbody radiation, the experiments on the pho-\\ntoelectric effect defied theoretical explanation for many years. Not until Albert \\nEinstein (Figure 4.19), using the ideas behind Equation 4.3, interpreted the ex-\\nperimental results were these observations understood. Einstein’s physical pic-\\nture was beautifully simple. He pictured electromagnetic radiation as a beam \\nof particles that he called photons. Each of the photons in the beam is a little \\npacket of energy with the value E = hn, just as in Equation 4.3. The intensity \\nof the radiation is proportional to the number of photons in the beam. If we \\ndenote the threshold frequency (below which no electrons can be ejected from \\nthe metallic surface), by n0, then the minimum energy required to eject an elec-\\ntron is hn0. The energy in excess of the energy required to eject an electron is \\ngiven by E = hn − hn0. This excess energy goes into the kinetic energy, E k, of the \\nejected electrons, and so we can write the equation\\n\\n E k = 0                (when n < n0)                         (4.4)\\n = hn – hn0 (when n > n0)\\n\\nWhen E k in Equation 4.4 is plotted against n, you obtain exactly the same \\ntype of curve as shown in Figure 4.18. The slope of the straight line is equal \\nto h, and when Einstein used Equation 4.4 to fit experimental data, he had to \\nuse the very same value of h that Planck had used to fit the experimental data \\nfor blackbody radiation.

Nevertheless, in the two very different experiments, blackbody ra-\\ndiation and the photoelectric effect, which had previously defied explanation, \\nthe very same constant, h, arose. Surely, this was no coincidence. These early \\ntheories were the first steps in the development of quantum theory that invoked \\nthe idea of quantization of energy, or of energy existing in little discrete pack-\\nets. Planck, who first recognized this in 1900, is called the father of quantum \\ntheory. In the next sections, we shall see that all phenomena that occur on the \\natomic and molecular level, including the atomic spectra that we discussed ear-\\nlier, are described by quantum theory.\\n\\n4-6.  De Broglie Was the First to Propose  \\nThat Matter has Wavelike Properties\\n\\nScientists have always had difficulty describing the nature of light. In many ex-\\nperiments light exhibits a definite wavelike character, but in others it seems to \\nbehave as a stream of little particles (photons). Because light appears sometimes \\nto be wavelike and sometimes to be particle-like, we talk of the wave-particle \\nduality of light. In 1924, Louis de Broglie (Figure 4.20), a French physicist, pro-\\nposed an unusual idea in his doctoral thesis: if light, which has wave properties, \\nalso can display particle-like properties under certain conditions, then matter, \\nwhich certainly appears to be particle-like, might also display wavelike proper-\\nties under certain conditions. This proposal is rather strange at first sight, but \\nit does suggest a nice symmetry in nature. Certainly, if light can appear to be \\nparticle-like at times, why shouldn’t matter appear to be wavelike at times?\\n\\nUsing the theory of relativity, De Broglie put this idea into a quantitative \\nscheme by proposing that both light and matter obey the equation\\n\\nλ = h_p  (4.6)\\n\\nwhere l is the de Broglie wavelength, h is the Planck constant, and p is the \\nmomentum of the particle. For a particle that is moving at a speed not too near \\nthe speed of light, the momentum, p, is given by mv, where m is the mass of the \\nparticle at rest and v is its speed. Momentum is proportional to both the mass \\nof an object and its speed. For example, a heavy truck has a greater momentum \\nthan a light car when both are moving at the same speed. Using the relation  \\np = mv, Equation 4.6 also can be written as\\n\\n λ =\\nh_\\n\\nmv  (4.7)\\n\\nFigure 4.20 Born in 1892 to a French \\naristocratic family, Duke Louis Victor \\nde Broglie studied history as an \\nundergraduate. His interest turned to \\nscience as a result of working with his \\nolder brother Maurice, who built his \\nown private X-ray research laboratory \\nin his family’s Paris mansion. His \\ninterest in wave properties matured \\nafter his assignment to radio \\ncommunications in World War I, \\nduring which he was stationed at the \\ntop of the Eiffel Tower. De Broglie \\nreceived a doctoral degree in physics \\nfrom the University of Paris in 1924. \\nAfter reading de Broglie’s doctoral \\nthesis on the wavelike properties of \\nmatter, Einstein praised the work, \\nsaying, “He has lifted one corner of \\nthe great veil!” De Broglie was awarded \\nthe Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929 “for \\nhis discovery of the wave nature of \\nelectrons.”\\n\\n\\n\\nEXaMPlE 4-6: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron travel-\\ning at 1.00% of the speed of light.\\n\\nSolution: The mass of an electron is 9.1094 × 10−31 kg (see the inside of the \\nback cover). Its speed is\\n\\nv = (0.0100)(2.9979 × 108 m·s−1) = 3.00 × 106 m·s−1\\n\\nso its momentum is\\n\\nmv = (9.1094 × 10−31 kg)(3.00 × 106 m·s−1) = 2.73 × 10−24 kg·m·s−1\\n\\nThe de Broglie wavelength of this electron is\\n\\nλ = h_mv =\\n\\n= 2.43 × 10–10 m = 0.243 nm\\n\\n6.626 × 10–34 J·s_\\n2.73 × 10–24 kg·m·s–1\\n\\nWe have used the fact that 1 J = 1 kg·m2·s−2. By referring to Figure 4.8, we \\nsee that the wavelength of the electron in this example corresponds to the \\nwavelength of X-rays.\\n\\nPracTIcE PrOBlEM 4-6: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength in meters \\nof a golf ball (45.9 grams) traveling at 120 miles per hour. Compare your \\nresult to the diameter of a golf ball.\\n\\nAnswer: 2.69 × 10−34 m; the value of l is totally negligible relative to the \\ndimensions of a golf ball.\\n\\nAlthough Practice Problem 4-6 shows that Equation 4.7 is of trivial con-\\nsequence for a macroscopic object like a golf ball, Example 4-6 predicts that \\nelectrons can act like X-rays. This effect is demonstrated in the electron micro-\\nscope, in which the wave nature of electrons is used to determine the size and \\nshapes of objects, much as light is used in a light microscope (Figure 4.21).\\n\\n4-7. Electrons Exhibit Both Particle-like and Wavelike Properties\\n\\nSubstantiation of de Broglie’s hypothesis was provided by the work of the British \\nscientist, G. P. Thomson, and the American scientist, C. Davisson, who shortly \\nafter the publication of de Broglie’s thesis independently discovered electron \\ndiffraction in 1926 and 1927, respectively. The two later shared the 1937 Nobel \\nPrize in Physics for this work.\\n\\nDiffraction is inherently a wave property. For instance, when a beam of  \\nX-rays is directed at a thin foil of a crystalline substance, the beam is scattered \\nin a definite manner characteristic of the atomic structure of the crystalline \\nsubstance. This phenomenon, called X-ray diffraction, happens because the \\nlength of the interatomic spacings in the crystal is close to the wavelength of \\nthe X-rays. The X-ray diffraction pattern obtained by irradiating a thin piece \\nof aluminum foil with X-rays is shown in Figure 4.22 (top). It is known in phys-\\n\\nFigure 4.21 An electron micrograph of \\npollen particles collected by filtering \\na pollen-laden air sample.

However, a beam of electrons produces a \\nsimilar pattern—called an electron diffraction pattern (Figure 4.22 bottom). \\nThe similarity of the two patterns demonstrates that indeed electrons can ex-\\nhibit wavelike behavior.\\n\\nThe contemporary view of nature is that electromagnetic radiation and \\nmatter can exhibit either wavelike or particle-like properties, depending on \\nthe experiment. For example, electromagnetic radiation appears to be wavelike \\nwhen diffraction experiments are performed, but it appears to be particle-like \\nwhen photoelectric effects are studied. Electrons, on the other hand, appear to \\nbe particles when they are studied in an apparatus like the one that J. J. Thom-\\nson used to discover them (Figure 2.18), but they appear to act like waves when \\ndirected at a suitable target in that they give rise to a diffraction pattern (Figure \\n4.22 bottom). This wave-particle duality appears to be an inherent property of \\nmatter that manifests itself whenever the mass of the particles involved is very \\nsmall (l = h/mv), as is the case for electrons and atoms.\\n\\nAn interesting visual metaphor for the concept of wave-particle duality is \\npresented in Figure 4.23. What we see in this picture depends, in part, on how \\nwe look at it. We see either one image or the other, but not both simultaneously. \\nThis same property is involved in the wave-particle duality concept. In effect, \\nthe electron has two faces—a wave face and a particle face. The two electron \\nfaces are mutually exclusive in that they are never seen simultaneously in a \\nsingle experiment. We see either the wave face or the particle face, but not both \\ntogether. In general, which face we see depends on the type of experiment we \\nare performing.\\n\\nAnother way to look at this seeming paradox is to view the problem as one \\nof misclassification. The wave-particle duality can be interpreted as the result \\nof our attempt to classify physical phenomena as either wavelike or particle-like  \\nbased on our macroscopic experiences, excluding the possibility that some \\nthings don’t fit neatly into either box. This is analogous to claiming the platy-\\npus is a strange animal because it is neither strictly a mammal nor a reptile. In \\nfact the platypus is not strange; it’s just a platypus. It’s the artificial line drawn \\nby us between mammals and reptiles that makes it seem strange. In the same \\nmanner, one can view the apparent physical contradictions that arise in quan-\\ntum theory as something requiring us to adjust our paradigms of what things \\nreally are.\\n\\nIt is interesting to note that it was J. J. Thomson who first showed, in 1895, \\nthat the electron is a subatomic particle; and it was G. P. Thomson who, along \\nwith others, first showed experimentally, in 1926, that the electron could act as \\na wave. The two Thomsons were father and son. The father received a Nobel \\nPrize in 1906 for showing that the electron is a particle, and the son received a \\nNobel Prize in 1937 for showing that it is a wave.\\n\\n4-8.  The Energy of the Electron in a  \\nhydrogen atom Is Quantized\\n\\nIn 1913, a young Danish physicist named Niels Bohr (Frontispiece) formulated \\na description of the hydrogen atom that successfully explained the observed \\natomic spectrum of hydrogen. A key postulate of the Bohr theory is that the \\nelectron in a hydrogen atom is restricted to only certain circular orbits about \\nthe nucleus. Ten years later, when de Broglie proposed the wave nature of elec-\\n\\nFigure 4.23 A pictorial metaphor of the \\nconcept of wave-particle duality. If you \\nstare at the illustration, we see either \\na young woman or an old witch. You \\nnever see both simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\ntrons, it became clear why a stable electron orbit results only when the de Bro-\\nglie wave associated with the bound electron has a suitable wavelength. Figure \\n4.24 shows that if the de Broglie waves of the electron do not match after a \\ncomplete revolution, then the waves cancel and the waves will progressively dis-\\nappear. The orbits will be stable only if the wave pattern matches with each \\nrevolution. This will only occur if some whole number of complete wavelengths, \\nn, fit around the circumference of the orbit. But we know that for an orbit of \\nradius r, the circumference is 2pr, so we have the quantum condition\\n\\n 2pr = nl;    n = 1, 2, 3, . . .           (4.8)\\n\\nUsing what is essentially this condition, together with the force balance con-\\ndition between the orbiting electron and the proton, Bohr showed that the only \\npossible energies of the electron in these orbits are given by\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nEn = = n = 1, 2, 3, …\\n\\n–2.1799 × 10–18 J_\\nn2\\n\\n–2.1799 aJ_\\nn2    \\n\\n  (4.9)\\n\\nNote that n is restricted to integer values. When n = 1, E1 = −2.18 aJ (to three \\nsignificant figures); when n = 2, E2 = −0.545 aJ; and so on. We say that the en-\\nergy is quantized because En can take on only discrete values. The En values \\ngiven by Equation 4.9 correspond to the allowed energy states of electrons in \\na hydrogen atom. A plot of these energy states as a function of n is given by the \\nhorizontal lines or levels shown in Figure 4.25. Note that the spacing between \\nsubsequent levels gets closer as the value of n in Equation 4.9 increases.\\n\\nBecause of the minus sign, all the energies given by Equation 4.9 are nega-\\ntive. The lowest energy is E1; and E1 < E2 < E3, and so on. By convention the state \\nof zero energy occurs when n = \\ue060, that is, E\\ue060 = 0. In this state of zero energy, the \\nproton and electron are so far apart that they do not attract each other at all \\n(that is, the atom is ionized), so we take their interaction energy to be zero. At \\ncloser distances, the proton and electron attract each other because they have \\nopposite charges. A negative energy state is more stable than a state of zero \\nenergy.\\n\\nAllowed energy states are called stationary states in quantum theory. The \\nstationary state of lowest energy is called the ground state, and the allowed \\nstates of higher energies are called excited states. In the hydrogen atom, the \\nstate with n = 1 is the ground state; the state with n = 2 is the first excited state; \\nthe state with n = 3 is the second excited state; and so on up to n = \\ue060, where the \\natom is ionized (the electron is no longer bound to the atom).\\n\\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n \\n04/08/09\\n\\n004-021\\n\\nFigure 4.24 An illustration of \\nmatching and mismatching de Broglie \\nwaves bound in Bohr orbits.

When an atom undergoes a transition from \\none stationary state to another, however, it emits or absorbs electromagnetic \\nradiation. Because the Bohr model proposed a limited number of stationary \\nstates, the photons emitted or absorbed can have only a limited number of en-\\nergies and, therefore, a limited number of frequencies. This limited number of \\nfrequencies results in a line spectrum.\\n\\nConsider a hydrogen atom that undergoes a transition from the n = 4 state \\nto the n = 2 state (Figure 4.25). In this case, the electron goes from a higher \\nenergy state to a lower energy state and a photon is released. The initial state \\nhere is a hydrogen atom in the n = 4 state and the final state is the n = 2 state \\nand a photon.

We shall discuss this approach in \\nthe next chapter, and in particular, we shall discuss the Schrödinger equation \\nthat successfully describes the electronic structure of not only multielectron \\natoms but molecules as well.\\n\\nsuMMary\\nFirst ionization energy is a periodic property (Figure 4.1). The values of succes-\\nsive ionization energies suggest that electrons in atoms are arranged in shells \\n(Figures 4.3 through 4.7), as depicted in Lewis electron-dot formulas given in \\nTable 4.2.\\n\\nIn 1900 Planck initiated quantum theory by postulating that electromag-\\nnetic radiation is emitted from heated bodies only in quanta, or little packets, \\nwith energies given by E = hv. Five years later Einstein used the same ideas to \\ndescribe the photoelectric effect. He showed that light, or electromagnetic ra-\\ndiation in general, can be viewed as a stream of particles called photons, whose \\nenergies are given by Planck’s formula, E = hn. Later de Broglie argued that if \\nlight can display particle-like properties in the form of photons, then particles \\nshould display wavelike properties. The wavelength associated with a moving \\nparticle is given by l = h/mv. De Broglie’s postulate was substantiated experi-\\nmentally by electron diffraction, where a crystal irradiated with electrons gives \\nthe same type of diffraction pattern as with X-rays. \\n\\nIn 1911 Neils Bohr formulated the first theory of the electronic structure \\nof a hydrogen atom. He proposed that the electron in a hydrogen atom is re-\\nstricted to only certain circular orbits, with the nucleus at the center. The elec-\\ntron in each allowed orbit has a different energy that results in the energy of \\nthe electron being quantized. The radiation emitted from an excited chemical \\nsample consists of a number of discrete lines, called a line spectrum. The emis-\\nsion spectrum generated by an excited atom is called an atomic emission spec-\\ntrum. Atoms absorb radiation of only certain wavelengths producing an atomic \\nabsorption spectrum. The emission spectrum of a hydrogen atom consists of \\nseveral series of lines. The hydrogen emission lines that appear in the visible \\nportion of the spectrum are called the Balmer series. The wavelengths of the \\nlines in the Balmer series are given by the Rydberg-Balmer equation.

He received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics \\nin 1910 from the University of Vienna. He then held a number of positions in Germany and in 1927 \\nsucceeded Max Planck at the University of Berlin. Schrödinger left Berlin in 1933 because of his opposition \\nto Hitler and Nazi policies and eventually moved to the University of Graz in Austria in 1936. After the \\ninvasion of Austria by Germany, he was forcibly removed from his professorship. He then moved to the \\nInstitute of Advanced Studies, which was created for him, at the University College, Dublin, Ireland. He \\nremained there for 17 years and then retired to his native Austria. Schrödinger shared the Nobel Prize \\nfor Physics with Paul Dirac in 1933 for the “discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory.” Oddly \\nenough, Schrödinger never accepted the probabilistic interpretation of wave functions, and he, along \\nwith Einstein, remained skeptical of this interpretation of quantum theory their entire lives. Schrödinger \\npreferred to work alone, and so no school developed around him, as it did for several other developers of \\nquantum theory. His pioneering influential book, What Is Life?, stimulated a number of physicists to work \\non biological problems.\\n\\nHis personal life was at best unconventional, as he apparently had numerous extramarital affairs. He \\nformulated what we now call the Schrödinger equation during a romantic vacation in the Swiss Alps with \\none of his paramours, whose identity has never been discovered. These stories have been engagingly related \\nby Walter Moore in his biography, Schrödinger (Cambridge University Press, 1989).\\n\\n\\n\\n137\\n\\n5. Quantum Theory and Atomic Structure\\n\\nIn the previous chapter, we discussed the early development of quantum   theory. We saw that the Bohr theory provided a spectacular explanation of \\nthe hydrogen atomic spectrum, but unfortunately could not be extended to \\natoms with more than one electron. In this chapter we shall discuss a radical \\ndeparture from the Bohr theory due to Heisenberg and Schrödinger that is ap-\\nplicable to multielectron atoms and molecules. The central result of this theory \\nis an equation called the Schrödinger equation that, as we shall see, can be \\nused to describe the arrangement of the electrons in atoms and molecules and \\nthat leads to a complete correlation between atomic structure and the periodic \\ntable. This theory ultimately explains most of the chemical properties of the \\nelements as well as the structure and shapes of molecules. Quantum theory is \\nessential to your understanding of what is to come, and this chapter is a pivotal \\none in your general chemistry course.\\n\\n5-1.  The Schrödinger Equation Is the Central Equation  \\nof Quantum Theory\\n\\nAs successful as the Bohr theory was in explaining the spectrum of a hydrogen \\natom, it could not explain the spectrum of any atom with more than one elec-\\ntron. Furthermore, later work showed that Bohr’s description of a well-defined \\norbit and momentum of the electron in a hydrogen atom was inconsistent with a \\nfundamental principle of nature called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. \\nIn the mid-1920s, a young German physicist, Werner Heisenberg (Figure 5.1), \\nshowed that it is not possible to measure accurately both the position and the \\nmomentum (mv, mass times velocity) of a particle simultaneously. This uncer-\\ntainty is not due to poor measurement or poor experimental technique, but is a \\nfundamental property of the act of measurement itself.\\n\\nLet’s consider a measurement of the position of an electron. If we wish to \\nlocate the electron to within a distance \\ue044x (where \\ue044x denotes the uncertainty \\nin the position x) along the x  axis, then we must use electromagnetic radiation \\nwith a wavelength at least as small as \\ue044x. In other words, for the electron to be \\n“seen,” a photon must interact or collide with it in some way; otherwise the pho-\\nton will just pass right by the electron and it will appear transparent.

The act of locating \\nthe electron, therefore, leads to a change in its momentum.\\n\\nHeisenberg’s analysis showed that it is not possible to determine exactly how \\nmuch of the momentum of the incoming photon is transferred to the electron \\nwhen the photon bounces off the electron. So the mere attempt to locate an \\nelectron to within a distance \\ue044x causes an uncertainty in its momentum. If we \\nassume that the minimum uncertainty in the position of the electron \\ue044x is on \\nthe order of λ, the wavelength associated with the photon, and the uncertainty \\nin the momentum \\ue044p is on the order of h / λ, then we find that (\\ue044x)(\\ue044p) is ap-\\nproximately greater than or equal to h. A more detailed analysis finds\\n\\n (5.1)\\n\\nwhere h  is the Planck constant. Equation 5.1 expresses the Heisenberg uncer-\\ntainty principle, which imposes a fundamental limitation on the accuracy of \\ndetermining simultaneously the position and the momentum of a particle like \\nthe electron due to the act of measurement itself.\\n\\nJust as in the case of the de Broglie wavelength of a moving particle, the \\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle is of no practical consequence for everyday \\nobjects such as airplanes and golf balls. In the macroscopic world, the forces \\ninvolved in the observation of an object are so small that they have virtually no \\neffect on the position or the momentum of the object. On the other hand, in \\nthe world of atomic and subatomic particles, the object being measured and \\nthe force acting on it (via the momentum of the photon) are of similar orders \\nof magnitude, and the very act of observation changes the position and mo-\\nmentum of the object. Therefore, Heisenberg’s principle has significant con-\\nsequences when applied to atomic and subatomic particles. The following Ex-\\nample and Practice Problem illustrate the effects of observation on the object \\nbeing observed.\\n\\nFigure 5.1 Werner Heisenberg (1901–\\n1976) was a leader in the development \\nof quantum theory in the 1920s and \\nformulated the uncertainty principle \\nthat bears his name. Heisenberg was \\nawarded the 1932 Nobel Prize for \\nPhysics. However, his role in Nazi \\nGermany is somewhat clouded. While \\nhe was in charge of the German project \\nto build an atomic bomb, it is still \\nunclear whether he actually helped or \\nhindered the effort.

These figures represent the \\nbest measurements possible under the given conditions.\\n\\nPrACTICE ProBLEM 5-1: Consider a golf ball with a mass of 45.9 grams \\ntraveling at 200 kilometers per hour.

QUANTUM ThEory ANd AToMIC STrUCTUrE140\\n\\nSchrödinger equation is too complicated to present here, we must discuss some \\nof its consequences.\\n\\nWhen we solve the Schrödinger equation for a hydrogen atom, we find that \\nthe energy of the electron is restricted to a discrete set of values that are the \\nsame as those predicted by the Bohr theory. That is, the energy of the elec-\\ntron is quantized and is restricted to the values given by Equation 4.9. So, the \\nSchrödinger (or quantum) theory and the Bohr theory give the same results for \\nthe atomic spectrum of hydrogen.\\n\\nThe Bohr theory and quantum theory differ completely, however, in their \\ndescriptions of the location of the electron about the nucleus. Instead of re-\\nstricting the electron to certain, precisely defined orbits, the Schrödinger wave \\nequation provides one or more functions, called wave functions, associated \\nwith each allowed energy. Wave functions, customarily denoted by the Greek \\nletter psi, ψ, are functions of the position of the electron. We emphasize this \\ndependence by writing ψ = ψ (x, y, z), where x, y, and z  are the coordinates used \\nto denote the position of the electron about the nucleus. The square of the \\nwave function, ψ 2(x, y, z), has the following physical interpretation: the value \\nof the square of the wave function is a probability density, in the sense that \\nψ 2 \\ue044V is the probability that the electron will be found in a small volume ele-\\nment \\ue044V surrounding the point (x, y, z). This is a remarkable statement. It says \\nthat we cannot locate the electron position precisely; we can only assign a prob-\\nability that the electron is in a certain region of space.\\n\\nBeing three-dimensional quantities, the wave functions for the electron in a \\nhydrogen atom, called hydrogen atomic orbitals, depend upon three quantum \\nnumbers that are commonly denoted by n, l, and ml. We shall discuss each of \\nthese quantum numbers in turn. (Orbitals are just a special type of wave func-\\ntion, and we shall often use the two terms interchangeably.)\\n\\nThe quantum number n  is called the principal quantum number. It alone \\ndetermines the energy of the electron in a hydrogen atom (as we shall see in \\nSection 5-5, this is not the case for multielectron atoms). We have already seen \\nthat n can take on the values n = 1, 2, 3, and so on. These values correlate to the \\nshells we discussed in Section 4-2. For example, orbitals sharing the quantum \\nnumber n = 1 may be referred to as being in the first shell, n = 2 as in the second \\nshell, and so forth.\\n\\nWhen n = 1, the energy is the lowest allowed value, which corresponds to \\nthe ground state of the hydrogen atom. The wave function that describes the \\nground state of the hydrogen atom depends only on the distance of the elec-\\ntron from the proton and can be written ψ(r), where r  is the distance of the \\nelectron from the proton. For reasons that we shall soon see, the ground state \\nwave function of the hydrogen atom is denoted by ψ1s rather than by just ψ1, and \\nthis orbital is called the hydrogen 1s orbital. The probability density, ψ 21s, is plot-\\nted in Figure 5.2. Note that probability density falls off rapidly with distance. \\nBecause ψ 21s depends on only the magnitude of r  and not on the direction of r \\nin space, ψ 21s is said to be spherically symmetric.\\n\\nSeveral other representations of atomic orbitals give a more informative pic-\\nture than a simple plot of the square of the wave function versus distance from \\nthe nucleus. For example, we can represent the hydrogen 1s orbital by the stip-\\npled diagram shown in Figure 5.3a. The number of dots in a volume element \\n\\ue044V is proportional to the probability of finding the electron in that volume. The \\n\\nFigure 5.2 A plot of ψ 21s  against r.

The Shape of an orbital depends on the Value of the \\nAzimuthal Quantum Number\\n\\nThe principal quantum number, n, specifies the effective size, or the extent, of \\nan orbital. The quantum number l  specifies the shape of an orbital. Orbitals \\nwith different values of l  have different shapes. This second quantum number is \\ncalled the azimuthal quantum number, although we could just as well call it the \\nshape quantum number because, as we shall see, the value of l  determines the \\nshape of an orbital.

An orbital for which n = 3 and l = 2 is called a 3d orbital. Table 5.1 \\nlists the orbitals for n = 1 through n = 4.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 5-2: Why is there no 2d orbital listed in Table 5.1?\\n\\nSolution: When n = 2, l can have only the values 0 or 1, because n – 1 = 1 \\nwhen n = 2. Thus, when n = 2, the maximum possible value of l  is 1. Because \\na d orbital has l  = 2, there is no such orbital as a 2d orbital.\\n\\nPrACTICE ProBLEM 5-2: Why is there no 3f orbital listed in Table 5.1?\\n\\nAnswer: A 3f orbital would require n = 3 and l  = 3, a state that is not allowed. \\nThe maximum value of l  is 2 when n = 3.\\n\\nIn a hydrogen atom, an electron occupying a 1s orbital has an energy that \\nis obtained from Equation 4.9 by setting n = 1. When n = 2, l  can be 0 or 1, so \\nwe have two possibilities, a 2s (n = 2, l  = 0) or a 2p (n = 2, l  = 1) orbital. Both \\nof these orbitals have a principal quantum number n  of 2, so an electron in \\na hydrogen atom described by either of these orbitals has an energy E2 given \\nby Equation 4.9. In quantum theory, two or more orbitals that have the same \\nenergy are said to be degenerate. The 2s and 2p orbitals have different shapes, \\nhowever, because they are associated with different values of l. \\n\\nAll s orbitals are spherically symmetric. In Figure 5.5, ψ 22s is plotted versus r. \\nThe radius of a sphere that encloses a 99% probability of finding the electron \\nin a 2s orbital is about 600 pm; the corresponding radius for a 1s orbital is about \\n200 pm (Figure 5.2). A 2s orbital has a higher electron density farther from \\nthe nucleus than a 1s orbital does. Figure 5.5 also shows that the electron prob-\\nability density is zero over a spherical surface whose radius is about 100 pm. All \\norbitals except the 1s orbital have a surface (or surfaces) on which the electron \\nprobability density is zero. Such surfaces are called nodal surfaces. Figure 5.5 \\nalso illustrates the relation between a plot of ψ 22s versus r  and a stippled diagram \\nrepresenting the 2s orbital probability density. The surface of 99% probability \\nfor a 2s orbital looks the same as that shown in Figure 5.3b for a 1s orbital, only \\nlarger.\\n\\nThe surface of 99% probability for a 3s orbital looks the same as that of a \\n2s orbital, only larger, having a radius of about 1300 pm. Figure 5.6 shows the \\nrelationship between a plot of ψ 23s versus r and a stippled representation of a 3s \\norbital.

We say that a 2p orbital is \\ncylindrically symmetric about its long axis (the z axis in Figure 5.7). Note that \\nthe xy plane that bisects the 2p orbital shown in Figure 5.7 is a nodal surface; the \\n2p orbital vanishes everywhere on that surface. Just as all s orbitals are spheri-\\ncally symmetric, all p orbitals are cylindrically symmetric about their long axis. \\nThe most important property of p orbitals for our purposes is that they are di-\\nrected along an axis, as shown in Figure 5.7.

QUANTUM ThEory ANd AToMIC STrUCTUrE144\\n\\n5-3.  The Spatial orientation of an orbital depends  \\non the Value of the Magnetic Quantum Number\\n\\nThe third quantum number, ml, called the magnetic quantum number, deter-\\nmines the spatial orientation of an orbital. It turns out that the magnetic quan-\\ntum number can assume integer values between l  and –l. Namely,\\n\\nl, (l –1), (l –2), . . . , 0, –1, –2, . . . , – l\\n\\nor ml = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . , ±l. The allowed values of ml depend on the value of l ac-\\ncording to the following table:\\n\\nl ml\\n\\n0 0\\n\\n 1 +1, 0, –1\\n\\n 2 +2, +1, 0, –1, –2\\n\\n 3 +3, +2, +1, 0, –1, –2, –3\\n\\nFor an s orbital, l  = 0, so the only value that ml can have is 0. For a p orbital, \\nl  = 1, so ml can have the values +1, 0, –1. Table 5.2 summarizes the allowed values \\nof l  and ml for n = 1 through n = 4.\\n\\nFor a given value of n and l, each unique value of ml describes a different \\norbital. Table 5.2 shows that there is only one s orbital for each value of n, three \\np orbitals for n \\ue024 2, five d orbitals for n \\ue024 3, and seven f orbitals for n \\ue024 4. For \\nexample, for a given shell (or value of n) each of the three p orbitals differs by \\nthe value of the magnetic quantum number, ml (= +1, 0, –1). All three orbitals \\nhave the same shape because they all have the same value of l (= 1), but they \\nhave different orientations in space because they all have different values of ml. \\nThe three 2p orbitals are shown in Figure 5.9. One 2p orbital is directed along \\nthe z axis, as depicted in Figure 5.7. The other two have the same shape as the \\none directed along the z axis but are directed along the x  axis and the y  axis, \\nrespectively. The p orbitals are designated by px, py, and pz, with the subscripts \\nindicating the axis along which the orbital is directed. Note that because an \\natom may have any orientation in space and because the energies of these three \\norbitals are degenerate, the specific designations (x, y, or z) assigned to the \\norbitals or axes are arbitrary.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 5-3: Without referring to Table 5.2, list all the values of l and ml \\nthat are allowed for n  = 3.\\n\\nSolution: When n  = 3, l  can have the values 0, 1, and 2.

For l = 1 \\nwe have a set of three 3p orbitals (for the 3p orbitals, l  = 1, so ml can be +1, \\n0, and –1); and for l  = 2 we have a set of five 3d orbitals (for the 3d orbitals, \\nl  = 2, so ml can be +2, +1, 0, –1, and –2).\\n\\ny\\n\\nx\\n\\nz\\n\\ny\\n\\nx\\n\\nz\\n\\ny\\n\\nx\\n\\nz\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/03/09\\n\\n005-009\\n\\nFigure 5.9 The three 2p orbitals.

The Energy States of Atoms with Two or More Electrons \\ndepend on the Values of Both n and l\\n\\nThe hydrogen atom wave functions serve as the prototype wave functions for all \\nother atoms. Equation 4.9 indicates that the energy of an electron in a hydro-\\ngen atom depends only on the principal quantum number, n, and not on the \\nother quantum numbers l, ml, and ms. Consequently, orbitals having the same \\nvalue of n, such as the 3s, 3p, and 3d orbitals, in a hydrogen atom are degener-\\nate (have the same energy), as shown in Figure 5.11a. This is not  the case, how-\\never, for atoms with more than one electron. In multielectron atoms there are \\nnot only electron-nucleus interactions but also electron-electron interactions. \\nBecause of these electron-electron interactions, for multielectron atoms the re-\\nlationship between energy and quantum numbers cannot be described using \\nEquation 4.9. The electronic energies of multielectron atoms depend in a com-\\nplicated way on the azimuthal quantum number, l, as well as on the principal \\nquantum number, n. Thus, for example, the 2s and 2p orbitals for atoms other \\nthan hydrogen have different energies.

Thus, orbitals with the same \\nvalue of n  but different values of l  have \\ndifferent energies.

As n increases, the \\ndependence of the energy on l  becomes so pronounced that the energy of the \\n4s orbital is less than that of the 3d orbital. As in the case of a hydrogen atom, \\nthe orbital energies bunch together as n  increases, so this type of reversal be-\\ncomes even more pronounced at higher energies. Fortunately, there is a simple \\nmnemonic device that helps us remember the order of the orbitals in most \\natoms (Figure 5.12).\\n\\n5-6.  The Pauli Exclusion Principle States That No  \\nTwo Electrons in the Same Atom Can have  \\nthe Same Set of Four Quantum Numbers\\n\\nBefore we can correlate electronic structure with the periodic table, we must \\nlearn how to assign the electrons to the various orbitals. It was Wolfgang Pauli \\n(Figure 5.13) who in 1926 first determined how to make this assignment. He \\nproposed that no two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four \\nquantum numbers. This idea is now called the Pauli exclusion principle.\\n\\nTable 5.4 lists the allowed sets of four quantum numbers (n, l, ml, ms) for \\nelectrons in atoms with n  = 1 to n  = 4. Only two combinations are allowed for \\nn  = 1: (1, 0, 0,       ) and (1, 0, 0,  ). Both combinations have n  = 1 and l  = 0, so \\nthey correspond to two electrons in a 1s orbital. The two electrons differ only \\nin their spin quantum numbers. We can represent this pictorially by a line with \\ntwo vertical arrows:\\n\\nThe line represents the orbital, and the two arrows represent the two elec-\\ntrons with different spin quantum numbers. The arrow pointing upward \\nrepresents an electron with ms =      , and the arrow pointing downward rep-\\nresents one with ms =  . This pictorial representation is so ingrained that \\nchemists often use the terms spin up and spin down to refer to electrons with \\nms =       and ms =  , respectively. When two electrons occupy an orbital, they \\nare said to have their electron spins paired. A single electron in an orbital has \\nits electron spin unpaired and is said to be an unpaired electron. According \\nto the Pauli exclusion principle, the spin quantum numbers of the electrons in \\na given orbital cannot be the same; if they were, the electrons would have the \\nsame set of four quantum numbers. Thus, the representations       and        are \\nnot allowed; they are forbidden.\\n\\nThe n  = 1 level is complete with two electrons because there are only two \\npossible sets of four quantum numbers with n  = 1. When n = 2, there are two \\npossible values of l, namely, 0 and 1. The l  = 0 value corresponds to a 2s orbital, \\nwhich can hold two electrons of opposite spins. The l  = 1 value corresponds to \\nthree 2p orbitals (ml = +1, 0, –1), each of which can hold two electrons of op-\\nposite spins, giving a total of six electrons in the three 2p orbitals. The n  = 2 \\nlevel, then, can hold a total of eight electrons (two in the 2s orbital and six in \\nthe three 2p orbitals). No more than two electrons can occupy any one orbital:\\n\\n5-6.

For n  = 2, there are two subshells: the s subshell, which consists \\nof one orbital that can contain a maximum of two electrons, and the p sub-\\nshell that consists of three orbitals and can contain a maximum of six electrons \\n(Table 5.4).\\n\\nFor n  = 3, we have 3s, 3p, and 3d subshells. The only new feature here is the \\nd  subshell. Because each d subshell contains five d  orbitals and each orbital can \\ncontain only two electrons with opposite spins, the d  subshell can contain up to \\n10 electrons. Thus, as Table 5.4 shows, the n  = 3 level, or third shell, can contain \\nup to 18 (= 2 + 6 + 10) electrons. The only new feature for n  = 4 is the f subshell. \\nBecause there are seven f  orbitals and each one can contain only two electrons \\nwith opposite spins, the f  subshell can contain up to 14 electrons, giving a total \\ncapacity of 32 (= 2 + 6 + 10 + 14) electrons for the n  = 4 level.\\n\\n5-7.  Electron Configurations designate the occupancy  \\nof Electrons in Atomic orbitals\\n\\nWe are now ready to use Table 5.4 to interpret some of the principal features of \\nthe periodic table in terms of electronic structure. Consider first a helium atom \\nwith its two electrons. The lowest energy state of a helium atom is achieved by \\nplacing both electrons in the 1s orbital because this orbital has the lowest en-\\nergy. Thus, we can represent the ground electronic state (the allowed electronic \\nstate of lowest energy) in a helium atom by       or by 1s2. The latter notation is \\nstandard. The 1s means that we are considering a 1s orbital, and the superscript \\n2 denotes the two electrons in the 1s orbital. It is understood that the electrons \\nhave different spin quantum numbers, or opposite spins. If we are depicting five \\nelectrons in the 3p orbitals, we write 3p5. The arrangement of electrons in the \\norbitals is called the electron configuration of the atom. Thus, we say that the \\nelectron configuration of the ground state of a helium atom is 1s2.\\n\\nLet’s go on now and consider the case of a lithium atom with its three elec-\\ntrons. It is not possible to place three electrons in a 1s orbital without violating \\nthe Pauli exclusion principle because two of the electrons would have the same \\nset of four quantum numbers. The 1s orbital is completely filled by two of the \\nelectrons, so the third electron must be assigned to the next available orbital, \\nthe 2s orbital. The electron in the 2s orbital can have ms =      \\n\\n or  , so we can \\nrepresent a lithium atom by\\n\\nThe direction of the arrow in the 2s orbital is not important here, but it is cus-\\ntomary to use the spin-up picture on the left. The standard notation is 1s22s1.\\n\\nIn Section 4-2 we used the experimental values of the ionization energies \\nfor a lithium atom given in Table 4.1 to argue that lithium can be represented \\nas a helium core with one outer electron. In Table 4.2, we represented a lithium \\natom by the electron-dot formula [He]• or Li •, which shows one valence elec-\\ntron. Now we see that this same conclusion follows naturally from quantum \\ntheory.\\n\\nThe ground state of a beryllium atom (Z = 4) is obtained by placing the \\n\\n5-7.

In \\nconfiguration (1), both electrons occupy the same p orbital and hence are re-\\nstricted, on the average, to the same region in space. In the other two cases, the \\ntwo electrons occupy different p orbitals, so they are, on average, in different re-\\ngions of space. Because electrons have the same charge and so repel each other, \\nthe placement of the two electrons into different p orbitals, and hence different \\nregions of space, minimizes the repulsion between the electrons. Thus, we con-\\nclude that configurations (2) and (3) have lower energies and are favored over \\nconfiguration (1). It has been determined experimentally that the configura-\\ntion in which the two p electrons are placed in different p orbitals with parallel \\nspins leads to the lowest energy, or ground state, configuration. Therefore, the \\nground state electron configuration of a carbon atom is\\n\\nThe standard notation is 1s22s22p1x2p1y  . This notation often is condensed to \\n1s22s22p2. In both cases the reader is assumed to know that the two 2p electrons \\nare unpaired and have parallel spins in the ground state. The choice of the x \\nand y axes for the two occupied p orbitals is arbitrary because the atom may \\nhave any orientation in space and all three 2p orbitals are degenerate. We could \\njust as well have written 1s22s22p1x2p1z  or 1s22s22p1y 2p1z.\\n\\nThe arguments given above can be generalized to give what is called Hund’s \\nrule, named after its originator, the German scientist Friedrich Hund: For any \\nset of orbitals of the same energy, that is, for any subshell, the ground state \\nelectron configuration is obtained by placing the electrons in different orbitals \\nof this set with parallel spins. No orbital in the subshell contains two electrons \\nuntil each orbital contains one electron. Using Hund’s rule, we write for a ni-\\ntrogen atom (Z = 7)\\n\\nThe standard notation is 1s22s22p1x2p1y 2p1z or in condensed notation, 1s22s22p3. \\nAgain, the three 2p electrons are understood to have parallel spins in the \\nground state.\\n\\nFor an oxygen atom (Z = 8), we begin to pair up the p electrons and obtain\\n\\nor 1s22s22p2x2p1y 2p1z, or simply 1s22s22p4. Once again, it does not matter into \\nwhich 2p orbital we place the paired electrons.

When an Atom Absorbs Electromagnetic radiation,  \\nElectrons Are Promoted to Excited States\\n\\nWe saw in Section 4-9 that an atom can absorb electromagnetic radiation. In \\nthis process an electron is promoted to an orbital of higher energy, and the \\natom is said to be in an excited state. For example, a lithium atom absorbs \\nelectromagnetic radiation of wavelength 671 nm and undergoes the electronic \\ntransition\\n\\nwhere hν represents the energy of the absorbed photon. We see that the elec-\\ntron in the 2s orbital is promoted to a 2p orbital in the process (Figure 5.14). \\nThe resulting lithium atom is in an excited state (as denoted by the asterisk), \\nand its excited state electron configuration is 1s22p1. The first excited state is \\nobtained by promoting the electron of highest energy in the ground state to \\nthe next available orbital. For our purposes in this chapter, we are interested \\nprimarily in ground electronic states, but we should realize that the ground \\nstate is just the lowest of a set of allowed atomic energy states.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 5-7: What is the electron configuration of the first excited state \\nof a neon atom?\\n\\nSolution: The ground state electron configuration of a neon atom is \\n1s22s22p6.

Elements in the Same Column of the Periodic Table  \\nhave Similar Valence-Electron Configurations\\n\\nAccording to either Figure 5.11b or Figure 5.12, after neon we use the 3s and 3p \\norbitals to obtain the electron configurations of the atoms in the next row of \\nthe periodic table.

Their valence electron configu-\\nrations range from ns1 to ns2np6 (n = 2 and n = 3, respectively) in the same man-\\nner.

The Chemistry of Transition Metal Elements depends  \\nupon Their d orbital Electrons\\n\\nOnce we reach calcium (Z = 20), the 4s orbital is completely filled. Figure 5.11b \\nshows that the next available orbitals are the five 3d orbitals. Each of these or-\\nbitals can be occupied by two electrons of opposite spin, giving a maximum \\nof 10 electrons in all. Note that this number corresponds perfectly with the \\n10 transition metals that occur between calcium and gallium in the periodic \\ntable. Thus, in the first set of transition metals, we see the sequential filling of \\nthe five 3d orbitals. Because of this, the first set of transition metals is called the \\n3d transition metal series. You may think that the ground state electron con-\\nfigurations of these 10 elements go smoothly from [Ar] 4s23d1 to [Ar] 4s23d10, \\nbut this is not so. The actual ground state electron configurations of the 3d \\ntransition metals are as shown in Table 5.9. We see that chromium and copper \\nhave only one 4s electron. In each case an electron has been taken from the 4s\\norbital in order to either half-fill or completely fill all the 3d orbitals. This fill-\\ning pattern results because an extra stability is realized by the valence electron  \\nconfigurations\\n\\nrelative to the incorrect  4s23d 4 and 4s23d 9 ground state valence electron configu-\\nrations for the neutral gaseous atoms of these elements. It so happens that the \\nenergies of the electrons in the 4s and 3d orbitals are very similar (Figure 5.11b), \\nand deviations from the regular filling order of these two orbitals—as well as \\nfor the 5s and 4d and 6s and 5d orbitals—are found, especially when such devia-\\ntions result in a half or completely filled d subshell (Figure 5.15). If you look \\ncarefully at Figure 5.15, you’ll see that even more irregularities show up in the \\nfilling order of the 4d series—at niobium (5s14d 4), molybdenum (5s14d 5), ruthe-\\nnium (5s14d 7), rhodium (5s14d 8), palladium (4d 10), and silver (5s14d 10)—than \\nin the 3d series. The unpaired 5s electron in silver explains the magnetic prop-\\nerties first observed by Stern and Gerlach, as described in the sidebox in Sec-\\ntion 5-4. In the 5d series there are only three irregularities in the filling order.\\n\\nAccording to Figure 5.11b, after the 3d orbitals are filled, the next available \\norbitals are the 4p orbitals, which fill up as shown in Table 5.10. For these six ele-\\nments, the 4p orbitals are sequentially filled, and these elements fall naturally \\ninto the fourth row of the periodic table under the sequence of elements boron \\nthrough neon and aluminum through argon, which fill the 2p and 3p orbitals, \\nrespectively (Figure 5.15). When writing electron configurations, we generally \\nlist orbitals in order of increasing energy (filling order). For example, we write \\n5s before 4d in the electronic configuration of a silver atom, [Kr]5s14d10.\\n\\nA krypton atom, like all the noble-gas atoms, has a completely filled set of p \\norbitals where the principal quantum number corresponds to the row in which \\nit is located in the periodic table. Figure 5.11b shows that the 5s orbital follows \\nthe 4p orbital, so we are back to the left-hand column of the periodic table with \\nthe alkali metal rubidium followed by the alkaline-earth metal strontium. The \\natoms of these two metals have the ground state electron configurations [Kr]5s1\\n\\nTABLE 5.10 ground state electron \\nconfigurations of the p-block fourth-\\nrow elements\\n\\nElement Ground state electron\\n                                 configuration\\n\\ngallium [Ar]4s23d104p1\\n\\ngermanium [Ar]4s23d104p2\\n\\narsenic [Ar]4s23d104p3\\n\\nselenium [Ar]4s23d104p4\\n\\nbromine [Ar]4s23d104p5\\n\\nkrypton [Ar]4s23d104p6 or [Kr]\\n\\nCr: and↑_\\n4s\\n\\n↑_\\n3d\\n\\n↑_ ↑_↑_ ↑_ Cu: ↑_\\n4s\\n\\n↑↓_\\n3d\\n\\n↑↓_ ↑↓_↑↓_ ↑↓_\\n\\nTABLE 5.9 ground state electron \\nconfigurations of the 3d transition \\nmetals.

The next available orbitals are the 4d orbitals, which \\nlead to the 4d\\ttransition metal series, yttrium through cadmium. The ground \\nstate electron configurations of the outer electrons of the atoms of these 10 met-\\nals (Figure 5.15) show irregularities like those found in the 3d transition metal \\nseries. After a cadmium atom, [Kr]5s24d 10, the 5p orbitals are filled to give the \\nsix elements indium through the noble gas xenon, which has the ground state \\nelectron configuration [Kr]5s24d 105p6 or simply [Xe]. As before, the completion \\nof a set of p orbitals leads to a noble gas located in the far right-hand column of \\nthe periodic table. The two reactive metals cesium and barium follow xenon by \\nfilling the 6s orbital to give atomic ground state electron configurations [Xe]6s1 \\nand [Xe]6s2, respectively.\\n\\nAfter filling the 6s orbital, we begin to fill the seven 4f orbitals. Because each \\nof these seven orbitals can hold two electrons of opposite spin, we expect that \\nthe atoms of the next 14 elements should involve the filling of the 4f orbitals. \\nThe elements lanthanum (Z = 57) through ytterbium (Z = 70) constitute what is \\ncalled the lanthanide series because the series begins with the element lantha-\\nnum in the periodic table. Figure 5.15 shows that, except for a few irregularities \\nlike those found for the d  transition metal series, the atoms of the lanthanides \\ninvolve a sequential filling of the seven 4f  orbitals. The chemistry of these ele-\\nments is so similar that for many years it proved quite difficult to separate them \\nfrom the naturally occurring mixtures. However, separations are now achieved \\nusing chromatographic and other methods.\\n\\nIf we consider that the lanthanides differ only in the number of electrons in \\nthe 4f subshells, with the 6s and 5p subshells already filled, the reason for their \\nchemical similarity becomes clear. According to quantum theory, the average \\ndistance of an electron from a nucleus depends on both the principal quan-\\ntum number n  and the azimuthal quantum number l . Although the average \\ndistance of an electron from the nucleus increases with n, it increases less as l \\nincreases than as n  increases. For this reason, the average distance of 4f (n  = 4, \\nl  = 3) electrons from the nucleus is less than that of 6s (n  = 6, l  = 0) or 5p (n  = 5, \\nl  = 1) electrons. The 4f  electron density, then, is concentrated toward the inte-\\nrior of the atom, so 4f  electrons have little effect on the chemical activity of the \\natom, which is dominated by the outer s  and p  electrons. For this reason, the \\nlanthanides are also called inner transition metals. The outer electron con-\\nfiguration, which plays a principal role in determining chemical activity, is the \\nsame for all the lanthanides (5p66s2) and accounts for their similar chemical \\nproperties.\\n\\nFollowing the lanthanides is a third transition metal series (the 5d transi-\\ntion metal series) consisting of the elements lutetium (Z = 71) through mercury \\n(Z = 80). This series, in which the 5d orbitals are filled, is followed by the six \\nelements thallium (Z = 81) through radon (Z = 86). Radon, a radioactive noble \\ngas with the ground state electron configuration [Xe]6s24f 145d106p6, or [Rn], \\nfinishes the sixth row of the table.\\n\\nThe next two elements, the radioactive metals francium, [Rn]7s1, and ra-\\ndium, [Rn]7s2, are followed by another inner transition metal series in which \\nthe 5f orbitals are filled. This series begins with actinium (Z = 89) and ends \\nwith nobelium (Z = 102), and is called the actinide series. All the elements in \\nthis series are radioactive. In fact, with the exception of trace quantities of plu-\\ntonium, the elements beyond uranium (Z = 92), called the transuranium ele-\\nments, have not been found in nature. They are synthesized in nuclear reactors \\n(see Interchapter O).\\n\\n5-11. ThE ChEMISTry oF TrANSITIoN METAL ELEMENTS 161\\n\\nThere are seven f orbitals, so you \\nmight expect a total of 14 elements \\nto occupy the lanthanide and actinide \\nseries. however, the current IUPAC \\nversion of the periodic table (Figure \\n5.15) places 15 members in each \\nseries because of both chemical and \\nelectronic structure considerations. \\nIn our discussion of orbital filling \\nwe take lutetium and lawrencium as \\nbeginning the 5d and 6d transition \\nmetal series, but we could just as well \\nhave chosen lanthanum and actinium. \\nSuch differences are of no concern to \\nus here.\\n\\nSee Interchapter O at  \\nwww.McQuarrieGeneralChemistry.com.\\n\\n\\n\\n5. QUANTUM ThEory ANd AToMIC STrUCTUrE162\\n\\nFigure 5.16 shows an expanded periodic table summarizing which orbitals \\nare filled as we move through the various regions of the table. These regions \\nare referred to as the s-block elements (Groups 1 and 2), the p-block elements \\n(Groups 13 through 18), the d-block elements (the transition metals, Groups 3 \\nthrough 12), and the f -block elements (the inner transition metals).\\n\\n5-12.  Atomic radii and Ionization Energies  \\nAre Periodic Properties\\n\\nAs can be seen from Figures 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6, the probability of finding an \\nelectron at some distance, r , from the nucleus decreases with increasing r . Even \\nthough the decrease occurs fairly rapidly with increasing r , it never actually \\nbecomes zero, even at very large distances from the nucleus. As a consequence, \\nit is not possible to define unambiguously an outer “edge” of an atom, that is, \\na distance beyond which there is zero probability of finding an electron asso-\\nciated with the nucleus. In other words, an atom has no sharp boundary. Al-\\nthough the Schrödinger equation is complicated for multielectron atoms, it can \\nbe solved with a computer. The results of such a calculation for an argon atom \\nare sketched in Figure 5.17. We can clearly discern three shells: the inner two \\nshells, the first shell and the second shell, are relatively well defined; the third, \\noutermost shell is much more diffuse.\\n\\nEven though atoms do not have well-defined edges, we can propose practi-\\ncal definitions for atomic radii based on models. For example, the atoms in a \\ncrystal of an element are arranged in ordered arrays. A simple version of such \\nan ordered array is shown in Figure 5.18, in which the atoms are arranged in a \\nsimple cubic array. If we propose that one-half of the distance between adjacent \\nnuclei in a simple cubic array constitutes an effective atomic radius, then we \\ncan determine atomic radii. Real crystals usually exist in more complicated geo-\\nmetric patterns than a simple cubic pattern, but effective atomic radii can still \\nbe deduced. Atomic radii obtained in this manner are called crystallographic \\n\\nFigure 5.17 The distribution of the \\nelectronic charge density versus the \\ndistance from the nucleus for an argon \\natom can be obtained by solving the \\nSchrödinger equation with a computer. \\nNote that there appear to be three \\nshells. Two of these are well defined \\nand close to the nucleus. The third, \\noutermost shell is more diffuse.\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n06/08/09 \\n\\n005-019\\n\\nr\\n\\nFigure 5.18 A simple cubic arrangement \\nof atoms in a crystal.\\n\\nEl\\nec\\n\\ntro\\nni\\n\\nc \\nch\\n\\nar\\nge\\n\\n d\\nen\\n\\nsi\\nty\\n\\nr\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n06/08/09\\n\\n005-018\\n\\n1s\\n\\n3d\\n\\n4f\\n\\n4p\\n\\n3p\\n\\n2p2s\\n\\n4d\\n\\n5f\\n\\n5p\\n\\n3s\\n\\n5d 6p\\n\\n4s\\n\\n5s\\n\\n6s\\n\\n7s 6d 7p\\n\\nO\\n\\nOX X X X\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nLanthanides\\n\\nActinides\\n\\nX O\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nXX X X O\\n\\nFigure 5.16 An expanded \\nperiodic table indicating which \\norbitals are filling up with \\nelectrons as we move through \\nvarious regions of the table. \\nThe colors designate the s-block \\n(blue), p-block (orange), d-block \\n(green), and f-block (purple) \\nelements.

The crystallographic radii of the elements are plotted against atomic \\nnumber in Figure 5.19; the resulting patterns indicate the periodic dependence \\nof crystallographic radii on atomic number.\\n\\nThe crystallographic radii of the atoms of the elements lithium through \\nfluorine decrease uniformly as we look from left to right across the periodic \\ntable. As the nuclear charge increases, the nucleus attracts the electrons more \\nstrongly. This same trend is seen in Figure 5.19 for the other rows of the peri-\\nodic table. Atomic radii of the main-group elements usually decrease as we look \\nfrom left to right in a row across the periodic table, as a consequence of the \\nsteady increase in nuclear charge within the row.\\n\\nThe crystallographic radii of the atoms of the alkali metal group also in-\\ncrease as we look down the periodic table within the group. Although the nu-\\nclear charge increases, the outermost electrons begin new shells, and, as shown \\nin Figure 5.20, this effect outweighs the increased nuclear attraction. Similar \\nbehavior is found for other groups in the periodic table.\\n\\nThe reasoning we have just used to explain the variation of atomic radii in \\nthe periodic table also can be used to explain variations in first ionization en-\\nergies (Figure 4.1). The atomic radius increases as we go down a group in the \\nperiodic table. The farther the electron is from the nucleus, the less the nuclear \\nattraction, so the more easily the electron is removed. Therefore, first ionization \\nenergies are seen to decrease as we look down the periodic table within a group. \\nSimilarly, the decrease in atomic size as we move from left to right across a row \\nof the periodic table due to the increase in nuclear charge is also reflected in \\nthe corresponding increase in first ionization energies. Trends in atomic radii \\nand ionization energies are thus seen to follow directly from quantum theory.\\n\\nSUMMAry\\nThe Bohr theory of the hydrogen atom could not be used to explain the atomic \\nspectra of multielectron atoms and also was inconsistent with the Heisenberg \\n\\nSUMMAry 163\\n\\nZ\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/03/09\\n\\n005-018\\n\\nr/\\npm\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\\n\\nLi\\n\\nF\\n\\nN\\n\\nS \\n\\nCl\\nBr\\n\\nNa\\n\\nK Transition\\nelements\\n\\nTransition\\nelements\\n\\nTransition\\nelements\\n\\nRb\\n\\nI\\n\\nBi\\n\\nLanthanide\\nseries\\n\\nCs\\n\\nFigure 5.20 The trend of atomic radii \\nin the periodic table.\\n\\nFigure 5.19 Crystallographic radii of \\nthe elements versus atomic number. \\nNote that atomic radius is a periodic \\nproperty.\\n\\nIncreasing\\nradius\\n\\nIncreasing radius\\n\\nLargest\\n\\nSmallest\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/03/09\\n\\n005-021\\n\\nx\\n\\n\\n\\n5.

One consequence of the Schrödinger equation is that the \\nelectrons in atoms and molecules can have only certain discrete, or quantized, \\nenergies. In addition, Schrödinger showed that an electron in an atom or mole-\\ncule must be described by a wave function, or orbital, that is obtained by solving \\nthe Schrödinger equation. The square of a wave function gives the probability \\ndensity associated with finding the electron in some region of space. The hydro-\\ngen atom orbitals serve as the prototype wave functions for all other atoms. The \\norbitals are specified by three quantum numbers: n, the principal quantum \\nnumber; l, the azimuthal quantum number; and ml, the magnetic quantum \\nnumber. Orbitals with l  = 0 are called s orbitals; orbitals with l  = 1 are called p \\norbitals; orbitals with l  = 2 are called d orbitals; and orbitals with l  = 3 are called \\nf orbitals. For various values of n, there is one s orbital, three p orbitals (for n \\ue024 \\n2), five d orbitals (for n \\ue024 3), and seven f orbitals (for n \\ue024 4) (see Table 5.4).\\n\\nTo explain certain fine details in atomic spectra, a fourth quantum number \\nis required. This is the spin quantum number, ms, that specifies the intrinsic spin \\nof an electron, a quantum property. The spin quantum number can have the \\nvalue of       or       .\\n\\nThe energy states of the hydrogen atom depend only on the principal quan-\\ntum number, n; for atoms with more than one electron (multielectron atoms), \\nthe energy states depend on both n and the azimuthal quantum number, l. \\nAccording to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons in an atom can \\nhave the same set of four quantum numbers (n, l, ml, ms). Using this principle \\nand the order of the energy states given in Figures 5.11b and 5.12, together \\nwith Hund’s rule, we are able to write ground state electron configurations and \\ncorrelate these with the periodic table. For main-group elements, the number \\nof valence electrons is equal to the number of electrons beyond the noble-gas \\ncore. (The electronic configuration of the transition metals is discussed more \\nthoroughly in the next two chapters.) Electron configurations enable us to un-\\nderstand the trends of chemical reactivity, atomic radii, and ionization energies \\nwithin the periodic table.\\n\\nHeisenberg uncertainty \\nprinciple 137\\n\\nSchrödinger equation 139\\nwave function, y 140\\nprobability density 140\\natomic orbital 140\\nprincipal quantum  \\n\\nnumber, n 140\\nspherically symmetric 140\\nazimuthal quantum  \\n\\nnumber, l 141\\ns orbital 142\\np orbital 142\\nd orbital 142\\nf orbital 142\\n\\ndegenerate 142\\nnodal surface 142\\ncylindrically symmetric 143\\nmagnetic quantum number, \\n\\nml 144\\nintrinsic electron spin 146\\nspin quantum number, ms 148\\nPauli exclusion principle 151\\nspin up 151\\nspin down 151\\npaired electrons 151\\nunpaired electrons 151\\nsubshell 153\\nground electronic state 153\\nelectron configuration 153\\n\\nparallel spins 155\\nHund’s rule 155\\nvalence electrons 158\\n3d transition metal series 160\\n4d transition metal series 161\\nlanthanide series 161\\ninner transition metals 161\\nactinide series 161\\ntransuranium elements 161\\ns-block elements 162\\np -block elements 162\\nd-block elements 162\\nf-block elements 162\\natomic radius 162\\ncrystallographic radius 162–163\\n\\nTErMS yoU ShoULd KNoW\\n\\n1_\\n2–\\n\\n1_\\n2+\\n\\n\\n\\nEQUATIoNS yoU ShoULd KNoW hoW To USE\\n\\n (5.1) ( Heisenberg uncertainty principle)\\n\\nn  = 1, 2, 3 . . .\\n\\nl  = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n – 1 \\n\\nml = l, (l – 1), (l – 2), . . . , 0, – 1, – 2, . . . , – l\\n\\nms =      \\n   or     \\n\\n (∆x)(∆p) ≥\\nh_\\n\\n4π\\n\\n1_\\n2+\\n\\n1_\\n2–\\n\\n\\ue04a quantum numbers\\nProBLEMS 165\\n\\nhEISENBErg UNCErTAINTy PrINCIPLE\\n\\n5-1.

(*) Although in general the ionization energy \\nof an atom increases from left to right as we move \\nacross a period, there are some anomalies in the \\ntrend.

He received his doctorate in 1884 from the \\nUniversity of Uppsala for his dissertation on the theory that electrolyte \\nsolutions contain ions that are formed when a salt dissolves in water \\nand that the ions are the conductors of electricity. His thesis work was \\nquite controversial at the time and was not accepted; in fact, he barely \\nobtained his doctorate. He then received a traveling scholarship, which \\nallowed him to spend five years studying in Europe, where his theory \\nwas enthusiastically accepted by the scientific community. In spite of \\nthe conservative scientific attitude in Sweden, he returned there, but he \\ncould not immediately obtain a university position. Swedish scientists \\ndid not accept his ionic theory and he became a teacher at the Technical \\nHigh School in Stockholm. In 1891, he became a lecturer at Stockholm \\nUniversity. Two years later, his position was elevated to professor at the \\nUniversity of Stockholm after he underwent an oral examination by a \\nhostile committee. He was awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\n“for his electrolytic theory of dissociations.” In 1904, Arrhenius became \\nthe first director of the newly created Nobel Institute for Physical Research \\nin Stockholm. In 1896, he studied the effect of carbon dioxide on the \\ntemperature of the earth’s atmosphere, now known as the greenhouse \\neffect. In addition to his research interests, Arrhenius was also an \\naccomplished writer and published a number of popular books.\\n\\n\\n\\n171\\n\\n6. Ionic Bonds and Compounds\\n\\nIn Chapter 5 we showed how the electronic structure of atoms underlies the structure of the periodic table. Therefore, it seems reasonable to suppose \\nthat an understanding of atomic structure should help us to understand the \\nchemical bonding that occurs between atoms in molecules. For example, we \\ncan use the electron configurations of the sodium atom and the chlorine atom \\nto understand why the chemical formula of sodium chloride is NaCl, instead of \\nNaCl2 or Na2Cl. We also can understand why sodium chloride is an ionic com-\\npound, capable of conducting an electric current when it is dissolved in water or \\nmelted. Similarly, in the next few chapters we shall study covalent compounds \\nand learn why carbon and hydrogen combine to form the stable molecule meth-\\nane with a formula CH4 instead of CH or CH2, and why nitrogen is a diatomic \\ngas with a formula N2 at room temperature. All these observations relate to the \\nbonding that occurs between atoms. The general properties of ionic and cova-\\nlent compounds differ greatly, as can be seen from the trends listed in Table 6.1. \\nIn this and the next few chapters we shall develop an understanding of these \\nobservations in terms of chemical bonds.\\n\\n6-1.  The Electrostatic Force That Binds Oppositely Charged Ions \\nTogether Is Called an Ionic Bond\\n\\nAs our first step toward understanding ionic bonding, we discuss an important \\nexperimental property of ionic compounds in aqueous solution. When most \\nionic compounds dissolve in water, the crystals break up into mobile ions rather \\nthan neutral molecules. For example, an aqueous solution of sodium chlo-\\nride consists of Na+(aq) and Cl–(aq) ions that are dispersed and free to move \\nthroughout the water. If electrodes (for example, strips of an inert metal such \\nas platinum) are connected to the poles of a battery and dipped into a solution \\ncontaining ions, then the positive ions are attracted to the negative electrode \\nand the negative ions are attracted to the positive electrode (Figure 6.1). The \\nmovement of the ions toward the respective electrodes constitutes an electric \\ncurrent through the solution.\\n\\nIn contrast, covalent compounds yield neutral molecules when they dissolve \\nin water and consequentially are poor conductors of an electric current because \\n\\n 6-1 Ionic Bonds\\n\\n 6-2 Ionic Charges and Chemical Formulas\\n\\n 6-3 Transition Metal Ions\\n\\n 6-4 Nomenclature of Transition Metal Ions\\n\\n 6-5  Ground State Configurations of \\n\\nTransition Metal Ions\\n\\n 6-6 Sizes of Ions\\n\\n 6-7 Ionic Bond Energies\\n\\n\\n\\n6.

For \\nexample, an aqueous solution of sucrose (table sugar), C12H22O11(aq), contains \\nneutral sucrose molecules, and so it does not conduct an electric current (Fig-\\nure 6.2).\\n\\nThe key to explaining observations such as these lies in understanding the \\ndifference between ionic and covalent bonding. To understand the bonding in \\nionic compounds, let’s first consider the reaction between a sodium atom and \\na chlorine atom. The ground state electron configurations of the sodium and \\nchlorine atoms are\\n\\nNa: [Ne]3s1  Cl: [Ne]3s23p5\\n\\nThe electron configuration of a sodium atom consists of a neonlike inner \\ncore with a 3s valence electron outside the core. If the sodium atom loses this 3s \\nelectron, then the resultant species is a sodium ion, with an electron configura-\\ntion like that of the noble gas neon. We can describe the ionization process by \\nthe equation\\n\\nNa([Ne]3s1) → Na+([Ne]) + e–\\n\\nRecall from Chapter 4 that once a sodium atom loses its 3s electron, the resul-\\ntant neonlike electron configuration is relatively stable to further ionization.\\n\\nIf a chlorine atom accepts an electron, then the resultant species is a chlo-\\nride ion, with an electron configuration like that of the noble gas argon. We can \\ndescribe the ionization process by the equation\\n\\nCl([Ne]3s23p5) + e– → Cl–([Ar])\\n\\nThus, we see that both a sodium atom and a chlorine atom can simultane-\\nously achieve noble-gas electron configurations through the transfer of an elec-\\ntron from the sodium atom to the chlorine atom. We can describe the electron \\ntransfer by the equation\\n\\nNa([Ne]3s1) + Cl([Ne]3s23p5) → Na+([Ne]) + Cl–([Ar])\\n\\nor, in terms of Lewis electron-dot formulas,\\n\\nNa+   +   Cl –\\n\\nNa+Cl–\\n\\nNa   +   Cl\\n\\nFigure 6.1 An aqueous solution of \\nNaCl(s) conducts an electric current. \\nAn electric voltage is applied by \\ndipping metal strips (electrodes) \\nattached to the poles of a battery into \\nthe solution. Like the poles of a battery, \\none of the electrodes is positive and \\nthe other is negative. The positively \\ncharged sodium ions are attracted \\nto the negative electrode, and the \\nnegatively charged chloride ions are \\nattracted to the positive electrode. \\nThus, the Na+(aq) ions migrate to the \\nleft in the figure and the Cl–(aq) ions \\nmigrate to the right. The migration of \\nthe ions constitutes an electric current \\nthrough the solution.\\n\\nProperties Ionic compounds Covalent compounds\\n\\nmolecular structure tend to form extended crystal tend to exist as individual \\n  lattices of alternating ions  molecules with shared electrons\\n\\nin solutions or liquid phase form ions, good conductors do not form ions,  \\n  of electricity  poor conductors of electricity\\n\\nmelting point high (all are solids at 25°C) varies, typically low\\n\\nTABlE 6.1 General comparison of ionic and covalent compounds\\n\\n + +– –\\n\\n–\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n+\\n\\n+\\nNa+ Cl–\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/03 /09\\n\\n006-001\\n\\nx\\n\\n\\n\\n173\\n\\nThe sodium ion and the chloride ion have opposite charges, so they attract \\neach other. This electrostatic force binds the ions together and is called an \\nionic bond.\\n\\nWe have seen that noble-gas electron configurations are relatively stable to \\nthe gain or loss of additional electrons. Because both sodium ions and chloride \\nions achieve a noble-gas electron configuration, the above reaction occurs eas-\\nily, and there is no tendency for additional electron transfer. Because a sodium \\natom readily loses one and only one electron, whereas a chlorine atom readily \\ngains one and only one electron, when a sodium atom reacts with a chlorine \\natom, the transfer of an electron from the sodium atom to the chlorine atom \\nresults in one sodium ion and one chloride ion. The compound, sodium chlo-\\nride, like all chemical compounds, is electrically neutral. Therefore, the chemi-\\ncal formula of sodium chloride must be NaCl and not NaCl2, Na2Cl, or anything \\nother than NaCl. From this we see that ionic compounds are composed of ions \\nand must be electrically neutral.\\n\\nLike sodium, the other metallic elements in Group 1 typically lose one elec-\\ntron in reactions to become +1 ions and achieve the electron arrangement of \\nthe preceding noble gas.\\n\\nEXAmplE 6-1: Predict the charge on a calcium ion.\\n\\nSolution: Calcium belongs to Group 2. Because a calcium atom has two \\nmore electrons than an argon atom, the electron configuration of a cal-\\ncium atom is Ca: [Ar]4s2. If it loses two electrons, then the Ca2+ ion achieves \\nthe relatively stable argonlike noble-gas electron configuration. When a \\ncalcium atom loses two electrons, the charge of the resulting calcium ion is \\n+2. We also can conclude that the other Group 2 elements also form stable \\n+2 ions.\\n\\npRACTICE pROBlEm 6-1: Predict the charge on an aluminum ion.\\n\\nAnswer: Al3+\\n\\nFigure 6.2 Comparison of the currents \\n(as measured using ammeters) through \\nequal concentrations of sodium chloride, \\nNaCl(aq), and sucrose, C12H22O11(aq). \\nThe solution of the strong electrolyte, \\nNaCl(aq), is a much better conductor \\nof electricity than the solution of the \\nnonelectrolyte, C12H22O11(aq).\\n\\n6-1.

As with fluorine, each of \\nthe halogens comes right before a noble gas in the periodic table, so we predict \\nthat all the halogen atoms can gain one electron to form halide ions with a \\ncharge of –1. Oxygen occurs two positions before neon in the periodic table, so \\nan oxygen atom has two fewer electrons than a neon atom. An oxygen atom can \\nachieve a neonlike electron arrangement by gaining two electrons to become \\nan oxide ion, which is written as O2–.\\n\\nEXAmplE 6-2: Predict the charge on a sulfide ion.\\n\\nSolution: Like oxygen, sulfur (Z = 16) is a Group 16 element with an elec-\\ntron configuration of [Ne]3s23p4.

We shall see repeatedly that a noble-gas electron \\nconfiguration is a particularly stable electron arrangement and that there is \\na strong tendency for this configuration to occur. This is especially true for \\nthe elements in the first two rows of the periodic table. Figure 6.3 shows some \\nof the atoms commonly encountered that lose or gain electrons to achieve a \\nnoble-gas electron configuration. All the ions in Figure 6.3 form a noble-gas \\nelectron configuration of ns2np6, except for Li+ and Be2+, which form a helium-\\nlike electron configuration of 1s2 when they form ions. The tendency of main-\\ngroup elements to form stable noble-gas-like ions with the configuration ns2np6\\n\\nis often referred to as the octet rule because there are eight (= 2 + 6) electrons \\nin the outer shell.\\n\\nMetallic elements lose electrons to become positively charged ions called \\ncations and nonmetallic elements gain electrons to become negatively charged \\nions called anions.

Although NaCl is the simplest formula \\nthat describes sodium chloride, it is in fact rare in nature to find individual so-\\ndium chloride molecules. For ionic compounds, the chemical formula is really \\njust the simplest formula that describes the ratio of the number of cations to \\nthe number of anions in the extended crystal (Figure 6.4a).

We shall learn more about the \\ndifferences between ionic and covalent compounds in the upcoming chapters.\\n\\n6-2.  Chemical Formulas of Ionic Compounds  \\nAre Based on Ionic Charge\\n\\nThe method of deducing the formulas of binary ionic compounds involving \\nions with noble-gas electron arrangements is straightforward. First we deter-\\nmine the positive or negative ionic charge of an element. We then balance the \\ntotal positive and negative charges by using appropriate numbers of cations and \\nanions. The ionic charges of some commonly encountered elements are shown \\nin Figure 6.3. The ionic charges in Figure 6.3 are the charges on the ions that \\nhave a noble-gas electron arrangement. Notice the correspondence between \\nthe ionic charge of the main-group elements and their position in the periodic \\ntable.\\n\\nA correct chemical formula is obtained by combining the atomic ions such \\nthat the total positive and negative charges are equal. For example, the correct \\nformula of strontium fluoride is SrF2(s) because a strontium ion has an ionic \\ncharge of +2 and a fluoride ion has an ionic charge of –1. It requires two fluo-\\nride ions to balance the +2 ionic charge of one strontium ion.

The Common Ionic Charges of Transition metal Ions  \\nCan Be understood in Terms of Electron Configurations\\n\\nThere are many metal ions not listed in Figure 6.3. For example, let’s con-\\nsider silver (Z = 47), which has the ground state electron configuration \\nAg: [Kr]5s14d 10. The silver atom would have to lose eleven electrons or gain \\nseven electrons to achieve a noble-gas electron configuration. A review of the \\ndata in Table 4.1 for other atoms suggests that the first of these alternatives \\nwould require an enormous amount of energy. The energy required for the \\naddition of seven electrons is also prohibitively large. Each successive electron \\nwould have to overcome a larger and larger repulsion as the negative charge on \\nthe ion increased. Consequently, atomic ions with a charge greater than three \\nare rare, but not unknown.\\n\\nAlthough a silver atom cannot reasonably be expected to achieve a noble-\\ngas configuration, its outer electron configuration would be 4s24p64d 10 if it lost \\nits 5s electron. This configuration, with 18 electrons in the outer shell, is a rela-\\ntively stable electron configuration and is sometimes called an 18-outer electron \\nconfiguration. The unusual stability of the ns2np6nd 10 outer electron configu-\\nration is often referred to simply as the 18-electron rule. Silver  forms an 18-\\nelectron rule ion, Ag+, by the loss of one electron, as described by\\n\\nAg([Kr]5s14d 10) → Ag+([Kr]4d 10) + e–\\n\\nor              \\n        Ag([Kr]5s14d 10) → Ag+(1s22s22p63s23p63d 104s24p64d 10) + e–\\n\\n6-3.

A zinc atom can achieve the 18-outer electron configuration \\n3s23p63d 10 by losing its two 4s electrons. Thus, we predict that the electron \\nconfiguration of a zinc ion is\\n\\nZn2+(1s22s22p63s23p63d 10) or Zn2+([Ar]3d 10)\\n\\nand its charge is +2, which is correct.

Note that these metals occur near the ends of the d transition series and \\nthat the charge on the ions increases by one unit as we look left to right along a \\nrow of the periodic table.\\n\\nAnother outer-electron configuration that is often found in ions is illus-\\ntrated by the element thallium (Z = 81). The electron configuration of a thal-\\nlium atom is [Xe]6s25d 106p1. Loss of the 6p electron yields the electron configu-\\nration [Xe] 6s25d 10 for a Tl+ ion. Although a Tl+ ion does not have a noble-gas \\noctet-rule electron configuration or an 18-electron-rule configuration, it does \\nhave all its subshells completely filled, and this type of electron configuration \\nis also relatively stable. Other elements that behave like thallium are shown \\nin Figure 6.6. Note that these elements are in Groups 13, 14, and 15.

For example, AgCl(s) is written as silver \\nchloride and not silver(I) chloride because the only common ionic charge of \\nsilver is +1. The common ionic charges of all the elements are given in the peri-\\nodic table on the inside front cover of this book. It should be noted that while \\nwe have given the common, or most typical, ionic charges of the elements found \\nin chemical compounds, other ionic charges are also possible.\\n\\nAn older nomenclature, which is still in use, changes the ending of the  \\nmetals’ names according to their ionic charge, rather than using Roman nu-\\nmerals. In the older nomenclature system, an -ous ending is used to indicate \\nthe lower common ionic charge, and an -ic ending to indicate the higher com-\\nmon ionic charge. Those ions with only one common ionic charge (like zinc \\nand silver) are given no special ending. Because some ions like cobalt can be \\n+2 and +3, while others like titanium are +3 and +4, this system requires that \\nyou memorize the common ionic charges in order to name a compound and \\nso is less convenient than the modern IUPAC system of nomenclature. Some \\nexamples of older names that follow these rules are shown below.\\n\\n Ion Systematic name Older name Ion Systematic name Older name\\n\\n Co2+ cobalt(II) cobaltous Ti3+ titanium(III) titanous\\n\\n Co3+ cobalt(III) cobaltic Ti4+ titanium(IV) titanic\\n\\n Tl+ thallium(I) thallous Zn2+ zinc zinc\\n\\n Tl3+ thallium(III) thallic\\n\\nIn addition to those metals that follow these rules, many others were named \\nusing their Latin roots in the older system. A list of such compounds is given \\nin Table 6.3. For example, iron(III) bromide is called ferric bromide in the \\nolder nomenclature. A compound that became famous as an ingredient in the \\nfirst fluoride-containing toothpastes is stannous fluoride, SnF2(s), the modern \\nname for which is tin(II) fluoride. For compounds with more than two com-\\nmon ionic charges, the naming is inconsistent. Often the name of the element \\nwas used with a Greek prefix indicating the number of anions. For example, \\n\\n\\n\\nchromium trioxide is the older name for what we now call chromium(VI) ox-\\nide, CrO3(s). In this book, in most cases we shall use the modern IUPAC (sys-\\ntematic) names of compounds or ions. However, you should still have some fa-\\nmiliarity with the older names in case you should encounter them elsewhere, \\nespecially in the older literature. The use of Roman numerals to denote the \\ncharge on the metal ion eliminates the need to specify the number of anions. \\nThus, iron(II) dichloride is redundant because iron(II) denotes Fe2+, which in \\nturn requires two chloride ions per formula unit to balance the charge on Fe2+. \\nFor this reason, the systematic name of FeCl2(s) is simply iron(II) chloride.\\n\\n6-5. The Filling Order of most Transition metal Ions Is Regular\\n\\nAs we have seen in the previous sections, the ground state electron configura-\\ntions of transition metal ions do not follow the same filling order as neutral \\natoms. Nevertheless, in most cases the ground state electron configurations of \\ntransition metal ions are relatively easy to deduce. We learned in Chapter 5 that \\nthe 3d orbitals are filled after the 4s orbital in neutral atoms. This order of fill-\\ning occurs because the order of energy levels for most neutral atoms is that shown \\nin Figures 5.11b and 5.12. However, when electrons are lost from a neutral atom, \\nthe charge on the ion alters the order of the orbital energies such that in most \\ntransition metal ions, the energy of the 3d orbitals is less than that of the 4s \\norbital. A similar situation occurs for the 4d and 5s orbitals and the 5d and 6s \\norbitals. Therefore, the filling order of the orbitals for the majority of transition \\nmetal ions is regular, in the sense that the order of orbital energies is\\n\\n Metal Ionic charge Symbols Modern systematic Old names \\n      (IUPAC) names\\n\\n copper +1 Cu+ copper(I) cuprous\\n\\n  +2 Cu2+ copper(II) cupric\\n\\n gold +1 Au+ gold(I) aurous\\n\\n  +3 Au3+ gold(III) auric\\n\\n iron +2 Fe2+ iron(II) ferrous\\n\\n  +3 Fe3+ iron(III) ferric\\n\\n lead +2 Pb2+ lead(II) plumbous\\n\\n  +4 Pb4+ lead(IV) plumbic\\n\\n mercury +1 Hg22+ mercury(I)* mercurous\\n\\n  +2 Hg2+ mercury (II) mercuric\\n\\n tin +2 Sn2+ tin(II) stannous\\n\\n  +4 Sn4+ tin(IV) stannic\\n\\nTABlE 6.3 metals with special older names and other exceptions (italicized)\\n\\n*Mercury(I) ion is dimeric (Hg2+2 ).

Cations Are Smaller and Anions Are larger  \\nThan Their neutral parent Atoms\\n\\nBecause atoms and ions are different species, we should expect atomic radii \\nand ionic radii to have different values. For example, the average distance from \\nthe nucleus of the 3s electron in a sodium atom is greater than that of the 1s, \\n2s, and 2p electrons because the 3s electron is in the n = 3 shell. When a sodium \\natom loses its 3s electron, only the n = 1 and n = 2 shells are occupied, so a Na+ \\nion is smaller than a sodium atom. In addition, the excess positive charge draws \\nthe remaining electrons toward the nucleus, causing the electron distribution \\nto contract. Positive atomic ions are always smaller than their corresponding \\nneutral atoms for this reason. As discussed in Section 5-12, we shall use the \\ncrystallographic radii of ions taken from X-ray data on ionic solids to estimate \\nthe size of these ions.\\n\\nThe relative sizes of the alkali metal atoms and ions are shown in the first \\ncolumn of Figure 6.8. The Group 2 metals lose two outer s electrons in becom-\\ning M2+ ions. The excess positive charge of +2 contracts the remaining electron \\nshells even more than in the case of the Group 1 metals, as you can see by com-\\nparing the sizes in the first and second columns of Figure 6.8.\\n\\nThe atoms of nonmetals gain electrons in becoming ions. The addition of an \\nextra electron increases the electron-electron repulsion and causes the electron \\ndistribution to expand. Negative ions are always larger than their correspond-\\ning neutral atoms for this reason. For example, the relative atomic and ionic \\nsizes of the halogen atoms and halide ions are shown in the column headed by \\n17 in Figure 6.8.

The excess positive \\ncharge of a K+ ion contracts the electron distribution, and the excess nega-\\ntive charge of a Cl– ion leads to an enlargement of the electron distribution, \\nso we predict that a Cl– ion is larger than a K+ ion.

Coulomb’s law Is used to Calculate  \\nthe Energy of an Ion pair\\n\\nUp to now our discussion of ionic bonds has been qualitative. We now show by \\ncalculations that when an ionic bond is formed, the energy of the ionic product \\nis lower than that of the atomic reactants. Let’s consider the reaction described \\nby the equation\\n\\n Na(g) + Cl(g) → Na+Cl–(g ) (6.1)\\n\\nBecause the energy of the Na+Cl–(g) product is less than that of the atomic re-\\nactants, energy is released in this process and a stable bond results. \\n\\nThe net energy change for the reaction can be calculated conveniently by \\nimagining the reaction to take place in three separate steps and then calculat-\\ning the sum of the energy changes for each of these steps:\\n\\n 1.   The electron is removed from the sodium atom (ionization). The energy \\nrequired to ionize a sodium atom is 0.824 aJ.\\n\\n 2.   The electron removed from the sodium atom is added to the chlorine \\natom. Energy is released in the process, and this energy is called the elec-\\ntron affinity of chlorine. (We discuss the idea of electron affinity below.) \\nThe electron affinity of atomic chlorine is –0.580 aJ.\\n\\n 3.   The sodium ion and chloride ion are brought together as shown in Figure \\n6.9. From Table 6.4 we see that the radius of a sodium ion is 102 pm and \\nthat of a chloride ion is 181 pm. Thus, the centers of the two ions are 181 + \\n102 = 283 pm apart when the two ions are just touching, assuming that the \\nions behave like hard spheres. We refer to the distance between the centers \\nof an ionically bonded ion pair as the equilibrium ion-pair separation \\ndistance, denoted by deq.\\n\\nStep 1 involves ionization energy, which we discussed in Section 4-1. We now \\nneed to discuss the energy associated with steps 2 and 3. Consider the process \\nof adding an electron to a gaseous atom:\\n\\nA(g) + e– → A–(g )\\n\\nThe energy associated with this process is called the first electron affinity, EA1, \\nof the atom A(g). For example, for a chlorine atom we have\\n\\nCl(g) + e– → Cl–(g)  EA1 = –0.580 aJ\\n\\nThe value of EA1 in this case is negative because energy is released in the \\nprocess.\\n\\nJust as we define successive ionization energies, we define successive elec-\\ntron affinities. For example, the first two electron affinities for an oxygen  \\natom are\\n\\nO(g) + e– → O–(g)  EA1 = –0.234 aJ\\n\\nO–(g) + e– → O2–(g) EA2 = +1.30 aJ\\n\\n6-7.

According \\nto Table 6.4, the sodium ion can be \\nrepresented as a hard sphere of radius \\n102 pm and the chloride ion can be \\nrepresented as a hard sphere of radius \\n181 pm. Because the two ions have \\nopposite charges, they draw together \\nuntil they touch, with a distance \\nbetween their centers of 102 pm +  \\n181 pm = 283 pm. They are bound \\ntogether at this distance in an ionic \\nbond. We call this value the equilibrium \\nion-pair separation distance, deq.\\n\\n\\n\\n6. IOnIC BOndS And COmpOundS186\\n\\nNotice that the value of the second electron affinity, EA2, is positive; it requires \\nenergy to overcome the repulsion between the negatively charged ion O–(g) \\nand the electron. The most important electron affinities for our purposes are \\nthose of the reactive nonmetals (Table 6.5).\\n\\nSo far then, for NaCl we can write for steps 1 and 2\\n\\nstep 1: Na(g ) → Na+(g ) + e–  I1 = 0.824 aJ\\n\\nstep 2: Cl(g ) + e– → Cl–(g ) EA1 = –0.580 aJ\\n\\nIf we add these two equations, we find that\\n\\nstep 1 + step 2: Na(g ) + Cl(g ) → Na+(g ) + Cl–(g) E1+2 = I1 + EA1 = 0.244 aJ\\n\\nEach of the species in this process is in the gas phase. The products Na+(g) \\nand Cl–(g ) are so far apart that they are effectively isolated entities. We now \\nmust calculate the energy change involved in bringing the two widely separated \\nions (where their energy of interaction is taken to be zero) to their equilibrium \\nion-pair separation distance of 283 pm (Figure 6.9). To calculate this energy, \\nwe use Coulomb’s law.\\n\\nCoulomb’s law (Figure 6.10) states that the energy of interaction of two ions \\nis directly proportional to the product of their electrical charges and is inversely \\nproportional to the distance between their centers. Thus, for the energy of in-\\nteraction we have\\n\\nQ1Q 2—\\nd\\n\\nEcoulomb = k\\n \\n\\n(6.2)\\n\\nwhere Q 1 and Q 2 are the charges of the two ions, d is the distance between the \\ncenters of the two ions, and k  is a proportionality constant. The value of the pro-\\nportionality constant k  depends on the units of the charges and of the distance \\nd. If the charges are measured in units of the charge on a proton (+1 for Na+, –1 \\nfor Cl–, and so on), d  is measured in picometers (1 pm = 10–12 m), and Ecoulomb is \\nexpressed in attojoules, then Ecoulomb is given by\\n\\nQ1Q 2—\\nd\\n\\nEcoulomb = (231 aJ·pm)\\n \\n\\n(6.3)\\n\\nThis relationship is illustrated in Figure 6.11. We see from Equation 6.3 that  \\nas d, the ion-pair distance, gets very large, the electrostatic energy of interac-\\ntion goes to zero. If the charges of the ions have the same sign, then Ecoulomb \\nin Equation 6.3 is positive. If the ions are oppositely charged, then Ecoulomb \\nis negative. Remember that like charges repel and opposite charges attract so \\nthat only ions with opposite charges can form stable ionic bonds. For a Na+Cl– \\nion pair, the charge on the sodium ion, Q 1, is +1, the charge on the chloride \\nanion, Q 2, is –1, and the distance between the ions, d, is 283 pm (= 102 pm + \\n181 pm).

From the first and second ionization energies of Ca(g ), we write\\n\\nCa(g ) → Ca+(g ) + e–  I1 = +0.980 aJ\\n\\n Ca+(g ) → Ca2+(g ) + e– I2 = +1.90 aJ\\n\\nThe sum of these ionization energies is E1 = I1 + I2 = 2.88 aJ.\\n\\n2. From Table 6.5 we see that the first electron affinity of O(g ) is –0.234 aJ \\nand its second electron affinity is +1.30 aJ,\\n\\nO(g ) + e– → O–(g)  EA1 = –0.234 aJ\\n\\n O–(g ) + e– → O2–(g) EA2 = +1.30 aJ\\n\\nThe sum of these electron affinity energies is E2 = EA1 + EA2 = 1.07 aJ. If we \\nadd the results of steps 1 and 2, we get\\n\\nCa(g ) + O(g ) → Ca2+(g ) + O2–(g)  E1+2 = +3.95 aJ\\n\\n3. We now calculate the energy involved in bringing Ca2+(g ) and O2–(g) \\nto a distance equal to their equilibrium ion-pair separation. According to \\nTable 6.4, the crystallographic radius of a Ca2+ ion is 100 pm and that of an \\nO2– ion is 140 pm. Thus, their equilibrium ion-pair distance is 240 pm. We \\nnow use Equation 6.3:\\n\\n(+2)(–2)\\n—\\n240 pm\\n\\nEcoulomb = (231 aJ·pm)\\n\\n= –3.85 aJ = –3.85 × 10–18 J\\n\\nThe minus sign indicates that energy is released in the process. We can \\nexpress this result in the form of an equation:\\n\\nCa2+(g ) + O2–(g ) → Ca2+O2–(g )   E3 = –3.85 aJ\\n  d=240 pm\\n\\nIf we combine this result with the net result of steps 1 and 2, then for the \\nequation\\n\\nCa(g ) + O(g ) → Ca2+O2–(g )\\n\\n\\n\\nwe get\\n\\nErxn = E1+2 + E3 = 3.95 aJ – 3.85 aJ = 0.10 aJ\\n\\nAlthough this value is positive, CaO forms a stable ionic solid; we have not \\nyet considered the energy involved in forming a crystal lattice.\\n\\nNotice that the coulombic energy released from the formation of a \\nCaO(g) ion pair (–3.85 aJ) from the separated ions in step 3 is about four \\ntimes greater than that released from the formation of an NaCl(g ) ion pair \\n(–0.816 aJ) due to the doubly charged calcium and oxygen ions.\\n\\npRACTICE pROBlEm 6-10: Calculate the value of Erxn for the reaction \\ndescribed by the equation\\n\\nCs(g) + Cl(g) → Cs+Cl–(g )\\n\\ngiven that the first ionization energy of Cs(g ) is 0.624 aJ.\\n\\nAnswer: Erxn = –0.619 aJ\\n\\nPurely ionic chemical bonds are the simplest type of chemical bonds. They \\nare the result of an electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions. \\nIf we know the ionic charges involved and their equilibrium ion pair distance, \\nthen we can use Equation 6.3 to calculate the energy released when an ionic \\nbond is formed.

The resultant energy is called the lattice energy of \\nthe crystal. In calculating lattice energies, we picture a crystal as made up of \\nsmall hard (impenetrable) spherical particles situated at lattice positions, as \\ndepicted in Figure 6.13a. In actuality, the particles are not completely impen-\\netrable and wiggle, or vibrate, a little bit about their equilibrium positions, but \\nour hard-sphere model is perfectly adequate for such calculations. One of the \\nreasons why all ionic compounds are solids at room temperature is because of \\nthe large amount of energy that must be supplied to break up these extended \\ncrystal lattices.\\n\\nTable 6.6 lists the calculated values of the lattice energy per formula unit for \\na number of ionic solids. You can see that the agreement between the calculated \\nand experimental values is quite good, which lends credence to the hard-sphere \\nmodel of ionic crystals that we have used for our calculations.\\n\\nNotice from Table 6.6 that the value of the lattice energy for NaCl(s), \\n–1.28 aJ per formula unit, is about one and a half times the magnitude of the \\ncoulombic energy per NaCl(g ) ion pair of –0.816 aJ that we calculated from \\nEquation 6.3. Similarly, from Table 6.6 we see that the value of the lattice en-\\nergy for CaO(s) is –5.67 aJ per formula unit, also about one and a half times \\nthe magnitude of the coulombic energy per CaO(g ) ion pair of –3.85 aJ that we \\ncalculated in Example 6.10.

An ionic compound is formed between two reactants if one of them has \\na relatively low ionization energy and the other has a relatively high electron af-\\nfinity. This event occurs when a reactive metal reacts with a reactive nonmetal. \\nWhen it occurs, one or more electrons are transferred completely from the \\nmetal atom to the nonmetal atom, a process resulting in an ionic bond.\\n\\nMany ions are stable because they achieve a noble-gas electron configura-\\ntion, although there are stable ions that have other types of electron configura-\\ntions as well, such as the 18-outer electron configuration. For most main-group \\nelements we can deduce the most stable ionic charge from the atom’s location \\nin the periodic table. Ions are different from atoms, so ionic radii are not the \\nsame as atomic radii. The relative sizes of ions and their trends in the periodic \\ntable can be understood in terms of electron configurations.\\n\\nMost transition metals and some main-group metals can have multiple ionic \\ncharges. When naming compounds containing a metal that has more than one \\ncommon ionic charge, we include the ionic charge of the metal after its name \\nin the compound using Roman numerals in parentheses.\\n\\nA quantitative discussion of the energetics of the formation of ionic com-\\npounds from their respective elements in the gas phase involves the concepts \\nof ionization energy, electron affinity, ion-pairing energy, and lattice energy.\\n\\nTERmS yOu ShOuld KnOw\\n\\npROBlEmS 191\\n\\nionic compound 171\\ncovalent compound 171\\nelectrostatic force 173\\nionic bond 173\\noctet rule 174\\ncation 174\\nanion 174\\n\\n18-outer electron \\nconfiguration 177\\n\\n18-electron rule 177\\nionic radii 183\\nisoelectronic 184\\nelectron affinity 185\\n\\nequilibrium ion-pair separation \\ndistance, deq 185\\n\\nfirst electron affinity, EA1 185\\nsecond electron affinity, EA2 186\\nCoulomb’s law 186\\nlattice energy 190\\n\\nAn EQuATIOn yOu ShOuld KnOw hOw TO uSE\\n\\nQ1Q 2—\\nd\\n\\nEcoulomb = (231 aJ·pm)\\n  \\n\\n(6.3)   (Coulomb’s law; d is the separation of the centers of the ions in \\npicometers and Q 1 and Q 2 are the charges on the ions in units of \\nthe charge on a proton.)\\n\\npROBlEmS\\n\\nnOmEnClATuRE And ChEmICAl FORmulAS\\n\\n6-1.

He was home \\nschooled until his teens, having learned to read at age three. His own children were also \\nhome schooled. At age 14, he entered the University of Nebraska and three years later \\ntransferred to Harvard University, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1899. After spending a \\nyear studying in Germany, he returned to Harvard as an instructor. Lewis left there in 1904 \\nto become Superintendent of Weights and Measures in the Philippines, and a year later \\ntook a position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There he became interested in \\natomic structure, leading to his development of electron-dot formulas. In 1912, he accepted \\nthe position of Dean of the College of Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley.  \\nAt Berkeley, Lewis held weekly workshops and discussions, where often the whole \\ndepartment would brainstorm new ideas and results. The department he ran became \\ngreater than the sum of its individuals, producing many outstanding chemists and not a \\nfew Nobel Prize winners. Lewis remained at Berkeley for the rest of his life, suffering a fatal \\nheart attack while working in his laboratory. Lewis made many important contributions \\nin chemistry. In the 1920s, he introduced Lewis formulas and described a covalent bond \\n(which he named) as a shared pair of electrons. Lewis was one of America’s outstanding \\nchemists. The chemistry department Lewis developed at Berkeley remains one of the finest \\nin the world. Lewis is one of the most outstanding chemists never to win a Nobel Prize.\\n\\n\\n\\n197\\n\\n7. Lewis Formulas\\n\\nIn the last chapter, we discussed how metals react with nonmetals to form   ionic compounds. Outer-shell electrons are transferred completely from one \\natom to another, a process resulting in electrostatic attraction—the ionic bond. \\nIn 1916, the American chemist G. N. Lewis (Frontispiece) postulated another \\nkind of chemical bond in which two atoms share a pair of electrons—a covalent \\nbond. Lewis published his results nearly a decade before the birth of the quan-\\ntum theory that was to give his idea of electron pairs, or covalent bonding, a \\nfirm theoretical basis.\\n\\nCovalent bonds make possible an enormous class of compounds. The com-\\npounds are poor conductors of an electric current, and many are gases or liq-\\nuids at room temperature (see Table 6.1). In this chapter, we investigate cova-\\nlent bonding by studying the method of writing molecular formulas that Lewis \\nintroduced. We also learn how to characterize bonds that are intermediate \\nbetween covalent and ionic bonds. Although a full understanding of covalent \\nbonding depends on quantum theory, which we consider in Chapter 9, Lewis \\nformulas remain one of the most useful concepts in chemistry.\\n\\n7-1.  A Covalent Bond Can Be Described as a  \\nPair of Electrons Shared by Two Atoms\\n\\nConsider the chlorine molecule, Cl2. The Lewis electron-dot formula for a chlo-\\nrine atom is\\n\\nRecall that a Lewis electron-dot formula for an atom shows only the valence \\nelectrons (generally the outer-shell electrons) and that the number of valence \\nelectrons in a main-group element is determined by its position in the periodic \\ntable. The chlorine atom is one electron short of having eight electrons in its \\nouter shell and achieving an argonlike electron configuration. One chlorine \\natom in Cl2 could get this electron from the other chlorine atom, but then that \\nchlorine atom would be two electrons short of a full octet, making it less stable. \\nIn a sense there is a stalemate with respect to electron transfer. Both atoms have \\nthe same driving force to gain an electron. From a more quantitative point of \\nview, although a chlorine atom has a large electron affinity (–0.580 aJ), it has \\na much higher ionization energy (2.09 aJ) and does not lose an electron easily. \\n\\n 7-1 Covalent Bonds\\n\\n 7-2 Octet Rule and Lewis Formulas\\n\\n 7-3 Hydrogen and Lewis Formulas\\n\\n 7-4 Formal Charges\\n\\n 7-5 Multiple Bonds\\n\\n 7-6 Resonance Hybrids\\n\\n 7-7 Free Radicals\\n\\n 7-8 Expanded Valence Shells\\n\\n 7-9 Electronegativity\\n\\n 7-10 Polar Bonds\\n\\n 7-11 Dipole Moments\\n\\nCl\\n\\n\\n\\n7. LEwiS FormuLAS198\\n\\nIonic bonds result in binary compounds only when one atomic reactant is a \\nmetal with a relatively low ionization energy and the other is a nonmetal with a \\nrelatively high electron affinity.\\n\\nAlthough we have ruled out the formation of an ionic bond in Cl2, there is \\na way for the two chlorine atoms to achieve an argonlike electron configuration \\nsimultaneously. If the two chlorine atoms share a pair of electrons between them, \\nthen the resulting distribution of valence electrons can be pictured as\\n\\nNotice that each chlorine atom has eight electrons in its outer shell:\\n\\nBy sharing a pair of electrons, each chlorine atom is able to achieve the stable \\nargonlike outer electron configuration of eight electrons. According to Lewis’s \\npicture, the shared electron pair is responsible for holding the two chlorine \\natoms together as a chlorine molecule. The bond formed between two atoms by \\na shared electron pair is called a covalent bond.\\n\\nThe electron-dot formula we have depicted for a Cl2 molecule is called a \\nLewis formula. It is conventional to indicate the electron-pair bond as a line \\njoining the two atoms and the other electrons as pairs of dots surrounding the \\natoms:\\n\\nIn general, the halogens have the Lewis formula X–X  , where X is a F, Cl, \\nBr, or I atom. The pairs of electrons that are not shared between the chlorine \\natoms are called lone electron pairs, or simply lone pairs. A Lewis formula de-\\npicts a covalent bond as a pair of electrons shared between two atoms.\\n\\nWhen Cl2(g ) is solidified (its freezing point is –101°C), it forms a molecular \\ncrystal (Figure 7.1). In contrast to the extended lattice of alternating ions in \\nan ionic crystal, the constituent particles of a molecular crystal are individual \\nmolecules. The low melting point of most molecular crystals, in this case chlo-\\nrine, indicates that the attraction between the molecules is weak relative to the \\nattraction between ions in an ionic crystal. Because chlorine molecules are neu-\\ntral, there is no net electrostatic attraction between them in the crystal. The \\ninteractions of neutral molecules are discussed in Chapter 15.\\n\\nFigure 7.2, which shows molecular models of the halogen molecules, can be \\nused to help define bond length. The drawings suggest that the nuclei of the two \\nhalogen atoms, like the ions in ionic bonds, are held at a certain equilibrium \\nseparation distance. We refer to this internuclear distance as the bond length. \\nTable 7.1 lists the bond lengths of the halogens. Note that the bond lengths of \\nthe diatomic halogen molecules increase as atomic number increases.\\n\\n7-2.  we Always Try to Satisfy the octet rule when  \\nwriting Lewis Formulas\\n\\nAs we saw in the previous section, each chlorine atom in a chlorine molecule \\nhas eight electrons in its outer shell.

This pattern is repeated \\nthroughout the crystal. Chlorine \\nmolecules are neutral, so they do \\nnot attract one another as strongly as \\nneighboring ions in an ionic lattice. \\nConsequently, molecular crystals like \\nCl2(s) usually have lower melting points \\nthan ionic crystals. The melting point \\nof Cl2(s) is –101°C. For comparison, the \\nmelting point of NaCl(s) is 800°C.\\n\\n\\n\\n199\\n\\noccupy its outer shell. It was Lewis’s genius that he noted this generalization ra-\\ntionalized the bonding in the overwhelming majority of chemical compounds. \\nWhen writing Lewis formulas, we always try to satisfy the octet rule. The octet \\nrule has its origin in the special stability of the noble-gas electron configuration \\nand was formulated by Lewis well before quantum theory was developed. Thus, \\nfor example, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine atoms achieve a neonlike \\nelectron configuration when they are surrounded by eight valence electrons. \\nWe shall show that, although there are exceptions to the octet rule, it is still \\nquite useful because of the large number of compounds that do obey it. We do \\nnot violate the octet rule in writing Lewis formulas unless there is a good reason \\nto do so. The following example illustrates how to apply the octet rule.\\n\\nWhen fluorine gas is bubbled through an aqueous solution of sodium hy-\\ndroxide, NaOH(aq), the pale yellow gas oxygen difluoride, OF2(g), is formed. \\nWe can deduce the Lewis formula for an OF2 molecule by first writing the Lewis \\nelectron-dot formulas for the atoms:\\n\\nF O F\\n\\nWe wish to join these three atoms such that each has eight electrons in its  \\nouter shell. Pictorially, we wish to join these atoms such that each one can be \\nwritten with eight valence electrons surrounding the nucleus. By bringing the \\nfluorine atoms in toward the oxygen atom, we see that the electron-dot for-\\nmula\\n\\nF O F\\n\\nallows each of the three atoms to be surrounded simultaneously by eight elec-\\ntrons. Thus, we conclude that a satisfactory Lewis formula for an OF2 molecule \\nin which each atom satisfies the octet rule is\\n\\nF O F\\n\\nAs a final check of this formula, note that there are 20 valence electrons in-\\ndicated in the Lewis formula for the molecule and that there is a total of 20 \\nvalence electrons (seven from each of the two fluorine atoms and six from the \\noxygen atom) in the Lewis electron-dot formulas for the individual atoms.\\n\\nThe Lewis formula for oxygen difluoride depicts the two fluorine atoms at-\\ntached to a central oxygen atom. One great utility of Lewis formulas is that they \\nsuggest which atoms are actually bonded to each other in a molecule.\\n\\nWe can write Lewis formulas in a systematic manner by using the following \\nfour-step procedure:\\n\\n 1.   Arrange the symbols of the atoms that are bonded together in the mol-\\necule next to one another. For oxygen difluoride we would write\\n\\nF\\u2003 \\u2003 O\\u2003 \\u2003 F\\n\\n   Although it may seem like a difficult step for you to decide how to arrange \\nthe atoms at this stage, you will become more confident with experience. \\nLater in this chapter we show why the O–F–F structure is unacceptable. At \\nthis stage, if there is only one atom of a particular element, it is a good first \\ntry to assume that this atom is the central atom (as in OF2) and that the \\n\\nFigure 7.2 Space-filling models of \\nthe halogen molecules, drawn to \\nscale to indicate the relative sizes of \\nthe atoms.

In this \\nsection we consider cases in which there are not enough electrons to satisfy the \\noctet rule for each atom using only single bonds. The ethene molecule, C2H4, \\ncommonly known as ethylene, serves as a good example (Figure 7.9). Using the \\nsame reasoning that we did for hydrazine, we arrange the atoms as\\n\\nH HC C\\n\\nH H\\n\\nAn ethylene molecule has a total of (2 × 4) + (4 × 1) = 12 valence electrons.

The carbon– \\ncarbon double bond in an C2H4 molecule is indeed shorter and stronger than, \\nfor example, the carbon–carbon single bond in an ethane molecule, H3C–CH3 \\n(Figure 7.8).

A resonance hybrid is a Superposition of Lewis Formulas\\nFor many molecules and ions, we can write two or more equally satisfactory \\nLewis formulas. For example, let’s consider a nitrite ion, NO2–. One Lewis for-\\nmula for a NO2– ion is\\n\\nN\\nO\\n\\n–\\nO\\n\\nOne of the oxygen atoms, the right-hand one as written, has a formal charge \\nof –1, having three lone pairs and one bond.

Both of \\nthese Lewis formulas satisfy the octet rule. When it is possible to write two or \\nmore satisfactory Lewis formulas without altering the positions of the nuclei, the \\nactual formula is viewed as an average, or as a superposition, of the individual \\nformulas. Each of the individual Lewis formulas is said to be a resonance form, \\nand the use of multiple Lewis formulas is called resonance.

Such a superimposed formula is called a \\nresonance hybrid because it is a hybrid of the various resonance forms. Each \\nof the nitrogen–oxygen bonds in a NO2– ion can be thought of as an average of \\na single bond and a double bond. The superimposed Lewis formulas suggest \\nthat the two nitrogen–oxygen bonds in a NO2– ion are equivalent. This idea is in \\naccord with experimental observation: the two bonds do have exactly the same \\nlength, 113 pm. Notice that using only one Lewis formula suggests that the two \\nnitrogen–oxygen bonds are not equivalent, one being a single bond and the \\nother being a double bond.\\n\\nThe resonance hybrid for a NO2– ion suggests that the –1 charge of the ion is \\nshared equally by the two oxygen atoms, rather than being completely on either \\none of the two oxygen atoms as suggested by either of the two resonance forms. \\nIn such a case, we say that the charge is delocalized. Resonance hybrids with \\ndelocalized charges have lower energies than their (hypothetical) individual \\nresonance forms. This difference in energy is called resonance energy.\\n\\nAnother example of the need to use resonance forms to obtain a satisfac-\\ntory picture of the distribution of electronic charge occurs in a nitrate ion, NO3–. \\nThree equally satisfactory Lewis formulas for a NO3– ion are shown below:\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\nO\\n\\n– – – –\\n\\n––\\n\\n+ + +\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\nO O O\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\n\\nBecause each of these formulas is equally satisfactory, the actual structure is \\nviewed as a superposition, or an average, of the three formulas and can be rep-\\nresented pictorially as the resonance hybrid\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nN\\nO\\n\\n–\\n\\nwhere the three dashed lines taken together represent a pair of bonding elec-\\ntrons spread over the three bonds. In this case each of the nitrogen–oxygen \\nbonds is an average of a double bond and two single bonds (from the three av-\\neraged resonance formulas). As the superimposed representation suggests, the \\nthree nitrogen–oxygen bonds are equivalent, in agreement with experimental \\nobservation that each nitrogen–oxygen bond is 122 pm in length. Furthermore, \\nthere are no chemical reactions that can be used to distinguish one oxygen \\natom from another in a nitrate ion, another observation suggesting that all \\nthree oxygen atoms are bonded equivalently to the nitrogen atom.\\n\\nThe need for resonance forms arises from the fact that the bonds repre-\\nsented by Lewis formulas involve equally shared electron-pairs. If the species \\ninvolves a bond intermediate between a single and a double bond, then we need \\nto write two or more Lewis formulas to describe the bonding in the molecule. \\nResonance is in no sense a real phenomenon (the molecule does not “alternate” \\nbetween the different representations).

The unusual stability of a benzene \\nmolecule is ascribed to what chemists call resonance stabilization: the energy \\nof the actual molecule, represented by a superposition of Lewis formulas, is \\nlower than the energy of any of its (hypothetical) individual Lewis formulas.\\n\\n7-7.  A Species with one or more unpaired Electrons  \\nis Called a Free radical\\n\\nAs useful as the octet rule is, in some cases it cannot be satisfied. In particular, \\nthe octet rule cannot be satisfied by each atom in a species with an odd total \\nnumber of electrons. For example, consider a nitrogen oxide molecule, NO, \\nwhich has 5 + 6 = 11 valence electrons. The Lewis electron-dot formulas of a \\nnitrogen and an oxygen atom are\\n\\nOandN\\n\\nIf we try to write a Lewis formula for a NO molecule, we find that it is not pos-\\nsible to satisfy the octet rule. The best that we can do is to write\\n\\norON ON\\n+–\\n\\nThe difficulty here is that the total number of valence electrons is an odd \\nnumber (11), so it is impossible to pair up all the electrons as we have been do-\\ning. A species that has one or more unpaired electrons is called a free radical. \\nBecause of the unpaired electron(s), free radicals are usually very reactive. \\n\\nAnother example of a free radical is provided by chlorine dioxide, ClO2(g), \\na yellow to reddish-yellow gas with an unpleasant odor similar to that of chlo-\\nrine; chlorine dioxide reacts explosively with many substances. The chlorine \\natom has seven valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has six valence elec-\\ntrons. Therefore, a ClO2 molecule has an odd number (19) of valence electrons. \\nThe two resonance forms with the lowest formal charge separation are\\n\\nand\\n++ ––\\n\\nO Cl O O Cl O\\n\\nThe ClO2 free radical is viewed as a hybrid of the resonance forms, and the two \\nchlorine–oxygen bonds in a ClO2 molecule are equivalent.\\n\\nThe molecules NO and ClO2 are free radicals. They have an odd number \\nof electrons, so they cannot satisfy the octet rule. Other compounds, called \\nelectron-deficient compounds, have an even number of outer electrons but do \\nnot have enough electrons to form octets about each atom. Compounds of be-\\nryllium and boron serve as good examples of electron-deficient compounds. \\nConsider the beryllium hydride molecule, BeH2. The electron-dot formulas for \\nthe beryllium atom and the hydrogen atom are\\n\\nBeandH\\n\\nA Lewis formula for a BeH2 molecule is\\n\\nBeH H\\n\\nThe beryllium atom is four electrons short of satisfying the octet rule. Electron-\\ndeficient molecules, like free radicals, generally are highly reactive.\\n\\nwhen writing the Lewis electron-\\ndot formulas for atoms it is not \\nrequired that the electrons be paired, \\nonly that the correct number of \\nvalence electrons be shown. Thus, \\nfor example, we can write the Lewis \\nelectron-dot formula for an oxygen \\natom as orO O\\n\\nSee Interchapter H at  \\nwww.McQuarrieGeneralChemistry.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nEXAmPLE 7-11: Suggest a Lewis formula for a boron trifluoride molecule, \\nBF3, that satisfies the octet rule. Suggest a reason why the electron-deficient \\nformula is preferred.\\n\\nSolution: Boron trifluoride is an electron-deficient molecule.

Nitrogen oxide, NO(g ), is a simple \\nmolecule that consists of just one oxygen atom and one nitrogen atom, \\nbut it has some amazing properties. It is both a toxic pollutant and an \\nimportant chemical signal in biological systems. The NO molecule is a \\nfree radical, having one unpaired electron that makes it a highly reactive \\nspecies. It occurs as an atmospheric pollutant because it is produced by \\nthe reaction between O2(g) and N2(g) at the high temperatures that exist \\nin the internal combustion engine. Its presence in the atmosphere leads \\nto the production of a number of toxic substances, such as NO2(g ) and \\nnitric acid. One function of catalytic converters is to convert NO(g) back \\nto O2(g) and N2(g).\\n\\nNitrogen oxide is produced naturally in various organs in the body. \\nAlthough NO(g) has a lifetime of a few seconds, it readily diffuses across \\ncell membranes. One important function of NO(g ) is to signal smooth \\nmuscles in blood vessels to relax, resulting in vasodilation and increased \\nblood flow. Nitroglycerin, which is used to treat heart conditions, acts by \\nproducing NO(g) in the body, thereby relaxing the muscles in the blood \\nvessels. Similarly, the drugs Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis all work by produc-\\ning NO(g) and relaxing blood vessels. Nitric oxide is an important chemi-\\ncal signal for a variety of other biological systems, such as the nervous \\nsystem and the immune system. The discoverers of the role of NO(g ) as \\na biological messenger, Robert F. Furchgott, Fedid Murad, and Louis J. \\nIgnarro, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1998.\\n\\n7-7.

Atoms of Elements Below the Second row in the  \\nPeriodic Table Can Expand Their valence Shells\\n\\nWe have not yet considered the case in which there are more valence electrons \\nthan are needed to satisfy the octet rule on each atom. Such a case can hap-\\npen when one of the elements in the compound lies below the second-row ele-\\nments carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine in the periodic table so that the \\nprincipal quantum number of the valence electrons is n > 2. Such elements will \\nusually be the central atom. In this case, we assign the “extra” electrons as lone \\npairs to that element, which we say has an expanded valence shell.\\n\\nAs an example, let’s write the Lewis formula for a sulfur tetrafluoride mol-\\necule, SF4. First we arrange the atoms as\\n\\nF S\\n\\nF\\n\\nF\\n\\nF\\n\\nOf the 6 + (4 × 7) = 34 valence electrons, we use eight electrons to form four \\nsulfur-fluorine bonds.

Because sulfur lies in the \\nthird row of the periodic table, we add these as a lone pair to the sulfur atom. \\nThe completed Lewis formula is\\n\\nF S\\n\\nF\\n\\nF\\n\\nF\\n\\nThe exact position of the lone pair of electrons on the sulfur atom is not impor-\\ntant; for example, we could just as well have placed the pair to the upper left \\nof the sulfur atom. Notice that the formal charges are 0 on all the atoms in the \\nLewis formula.\\n\\nIn a sulfur tetrafluoride molecule, SF4, sulfur expands its valence shell by \\nusing its 3d orbitals. It is not possible for the atoms of elements in the second \\nrow of the periodic table to expand their valence shells beyond eight electrons \\nbecause second-row elements complete the n = 2 shell, which does not contain \\nd orbitals, when they satisfy the octet rule. Second-row elements would have to \\nuse orbitals in the n = 3 shell to accommodate more electrons, but the energies \\nof the orbitals in the n = 3 shell are much higher than those of the orbitals in \\nthe n = 2 shell. Thus, although SF4(g) has been synthesized, OF4(g ) has never \\nbeen observed.\\n\\nEXAmPLE 7-12: Xenon difluoride, XeF2(s), was one of the first \\nnoble-gas-containing compounds to be prepared (see Interchapter K). \\nWrite the Lewis formula for the XeF2 molecule.\\n\\nSolution: We arrange the atoms as\\n\\nF Xe F\\n\\nOf the 8 + (2 × 7) = 22 valence electrons, four are used to form the two \\nxenon–fluorine bonds.

Electronegativity is a Periodic Property\\nAlthough we have discussed ionic bonds and covalent bonds in this and the \\nprevious chapter as distinct cases, most chemical bonds are neither purely ionic \\nnor purely covalent, but rather are intermediate between the two. The bond in  \\na hydrogen chloride molecule, HCl, serves as a good example of this point.\\n\\nWhen we introduced the concept of formal charge, we arbitrarily assigned \\n\\n\\n\\none of the electrons in the covalent bond to each atom. The formal charges of \\nthe H atom and the Cl atom in a HCl molecule are 0. We emphasize here that \\nthis procedure is formal and arbitrary, however useful. When we assign formal \\ncharges we are tacitly assuming that the electrons in the covalent bond are \\nshared equally by the hydrogen atom and the chlorine atom. We know, however, \\nthat different isolated atoms have different ionization energies and different \\nelectron affinities. It seems reasonable to assume that different atoms will also \\nattract electrons differently when they are covalently bonded.\\n\\nElectronegativity is a measure of the tendency with which an atom in a mol-\\necule attracts the electrons in its covalent bonds with other atoms. The larger \\nthe electronegativity of an atom, the greater the attraction of the atom for the \\nelectrons in its covalent bonds. As we shall see, electronegativity differences can \\nalso be used to predict the charge distribution in a bond and to select or reject \\na Lewis formula. However, electronegativity is a derived quantity in that it is not \\ndirectly measurable. Over the years various electronegativity scales have been \\nproposed. The electronegativity scale most commonly used today was proposed \\nin the 1930s by the American chemist Linus Pauling (Chapter 9 Frontispiece). \\nThe Pauling electronegativities range from 0 (least electronegative) to 4 (most \\nelectronegative) for each of the elements in the periodic table (Figure 7.13). \\nNote that the noble gases are not assigned a value because they typically do not \\nform compounds with other elements.\\n\\nIn Figure 7.14, the Pauling electronegativities are plotted against atomic \\nnumber. Figure 7.14 shows clearly that electronegativity is a periodic property. \\nWe see that electronegativities increase from left to right across the short (sec-\\nond and third) rows of the periodic table, as the elements become increasingly \\nnonmetallic. Furthermore, electronegativities decrease in going down a col-\\numn (Figure 7.13) because the nuclear attraction of the outer electrons de-\\ncreases as the size of the atom increases.

If the electronegativ-\\nities are nearly the same, or less than about 0.4, then the electrons in the bond \\nare essentially shared equally and the bond is called a pure covalent bond, or a \\nnonpolar bond. Equal sharing of bonding electrons occurs in homonuclear di-\\natomic molecules. If the electronegativities of the two atoms differ by about 0.4 \\nor more, then electrons in the bond are not shared equally and the bond is said \\nto be a polar covalent bond. The extreme case of a polar bond occurs when the \\ndifference in electronegativities is large, say, greater than about 2.0. For such a \\ncase, the electron pair is completely on the more electronegative atom, and the \\nbond is a pure ionic bond.\\n\\nBond character: Covalent Polar covalent Ionic\\n\\nElectronegativity difference:   ≈0 – 0.3  ≈0.4 – 2.0  ≈2.1 – 4.0\\n\\nPa\\nul\\n\\nin\\ng \\n\\nel\\nec\\n\\ntro\\nne\\n\\nga\\ntiv\\n\\nity 3.0\\n\\n4.0\\n\\n2.0\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n0\\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\\n\\nAtomic number\\n\\nF\\n\\nCl\\nBr\\n\\nI\\nAt\\n\\nFrCsRb\\nKNa\\n\\nLi\\n\\nFigure 7.14 Pauling electronegativities \\nplotted against atomic number.\\n\\nFigure 7.15 The trends of \\nelectronegativities in the periodic table.\\n\\nLowest\\n\\nHighest\\n\\nIncreasing\\nelectronegativity\\n\\nIncreasing electronegativity\\n\\nNot\\nelectronegative\\n\\n\\n\\nA polar covalent bond can be illustrated by a HCl molecule. According to \\nFigure 7.13, the electronegativity of a hydrogen atom is 2.1 and that of a chlo-\\nrine atom is 3.16, and the difference between them is 1.1. Thus, the electrons \\nin the bond are not shared equally. Because the electronegativity of a chlorine \\natom is greater than that of a hydrogen atom, the chlorine atom attracts the \\nelectron pair more strongly than the hydrogen atom does. The bonding elec-\\ntrons are shifted a little toward the chlorine atom, so it acquires a partial nega-\\ntive charge, thereby leaving the hydrogen atom with a partial positive charge; \\nthat is, the bond is polar. We indicate partial charges by the lowercase Greek \\nletter delta, d, and we write\\n\\nδ–δ+\\nH Cl\\n\\nIt is important to understand that d+ and d– represents only the fraction of an \\nelectronic charge that results from the unequal sharing of the electrons in the \\ncovalent bond. The numerical value of d is of no importance to us at this stage. \\nIt denotes only that the hydrogen atom is slightly positively charged and that the \\nchlorine atom is slightly negatively charged. From a quantum theoretical point \\nof view, d represents the fact that the two electrons in a covalent bond are more \\nlikely to be found near the chlorine atom than near the hydrogen atom. We say \\nthat the bond in a HCl molecule has partial ionic character.\\n\\nEXAmPLE 7-15: Describe the charge distribution in a molecule of the \\ninterhalogen compound chlorine fluoride, ClF.\\n\\nSolution: According to Figure 7.13, the electronegativity of a F atom is \\n3.98 and that of a Cl atom is 3.16, so the chlorine-fluorine bond is a polar \\ncovalent bond. The electron pair is somewhat more likely to be found near \\nthe fluorine atom than near the chlorine atom. Thus, the fluorine atom has \\na slightly negative charge, d–, and the chlorine atom has a slightly positive \\ncharge, d+. We can represent this polar bond by writing its Lewis formula\\n\\nδ–δ+\\nCl F\\n\\nPrACTiCE ProBLEm 7-15: Describe the charge distribution in a water \\nmolecule, which has a bent shape.\\n\\nAnswer:\\n\\nδ+\\n\\n2δ–\\n\\nδ+\\nO\\n\\nHH\\n\\nEXAmPLE 7-16: Using the electronegativities given in Figure 7.13, predict \\nwhether the bonds in calcium oxide and mercury(II) chloride are covalent, \\npolar covalent, or ionic.\\n\\n7-10.

LEwiS FormuLAS226\\n\\nSolution: The difference in the electronegativities of a calcium atom and an \\noxygen atom is 3.44 – 1.00 = 2.44. This difference is larger than 2.0, so we \\npredict that the bonding in CaO is ionic. The difference in the electronega-\\ntivities of a mercury atom and a chlorine atom is 3.16 – 2.00 = 1.16, so we \\npredict that the bonding in HgCl2 is polar covalent (or covalent with ionic \\ncharacter).\\n\\nPrACTiCE ProBLEm 7-16: Using the electronegativities given in Figure \\n7.13, discuss the bonding in a silane molecule, SiH4, and a BeCl2 molecule.\\n\\nAnswer: The bonding in a silane molecule is covalent with a small degree of \\nionic character and the bonding in a BeCl2 molecule is polar covalent with \\na fair degree of ionic character.\\n\\nElectronegativity can also be used to help write (or reject) Lewis formulas. \\nFor example, in Section 7-4 we rejected the Lewis formula shown in the mar-\\ngin for an OF2 molecule because of the separation of formal charges in the \\nmolecule as written. In addition to this, a formal charge of +1 on a very elec-\\ntronegative atom (recall that fluorine is the most electronegative atom) is not \\nchemically reasonable because a fluorine atom tends to gain electrons, not lose \\nthem. Notice also that in Practice Problem 7-14 the formulas\\n\\nO P\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nO OP\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nO OP\\n\\nO\\n– –\\n\\n–\\n\\n– 2– 3–\\n\\nand their equivalents were not considered as resonance forms of the phosphate \\nion. We did not consider these formulas because in each case there is a nega-\\ntive formal charge on the less electronegative phosphorous atom. In general, if \\nthere is a choice, negative formal charges should be placed on the more elec-\\ntronegative elements and positive formal charges on the less electronegative \\nelements.\\n\\n7-11.  Polyatomic molecules with Polar Bonds  \\nmay Be Polar or Nonpolar\\n\\nOne measure of the polarity of a diatomic molecule is its dipole moment. The \\ndipole moment customarily is represented as an arrow pointing along the bond \\nfrom d– to d+. For a HCl molecule and a ClF molecule, for example, we have\\n\\nCl Fand\\n\\nδ+ δ– δ+ δ–\\n\\nH Cl\\n\\nThis notation indicates the direction of the dipole moment. The magnitude \\nof the dipole moment is the absolute value of the product of the length of the \\nbond and the net charge on either atom. Dipole moments can be measured \\n\\nF\\n\\noxygen difluoride\\n\\nF O\\n–\\n\\n\\n\\nexperimentally, and the dipole moments of the hydrogen halides are given in \\nTable 7.4. Note the dependence of the dipole moment on the electronegativity \\ndifference. The larger the difference in electronegativity, the larger the dipole \\nmoment.\\n\\nA quantity that has magnitude and direction is called a vector. Dipole mo-\\nments are vector quantities. To understand the properties of a vector quantity, \\nconsider a familiar example: the force with which you pull on something. A \\nforce must be described by both the direction in which it is applied and its mag-\\nnitude. Like forces, vectors cancel if applied with the same magnitude in exactly \\nopposite directions. In a stalemated tug of war, both teams are pulling with the \\nsame magnitude of force but in opposing directions. The net result is an effec-\\ntive cancellation. This idea can be illustrated pictorially as follows:\\n\\nor =   no net force\\n\\nEven if they are equal in magnitude, if the forces are not applied in opposing \\ndirections, then there is a resultant net force:\\n\\ntwo forces\\non an object\\n\\n=\\n\\nnet force on\\nthe object\\n\\nIt will not be necessary for us to be able to calculate the magnitude of the net \\nforce. We need only see pictorially the direction of the net force.\\n\\nIn a polyatomic molecule (a molecule with more than two atoms), the po-\\nlarity of each bond, like the dipole moment of a diatomic molecule, can be rep-\\nresented by an arrow and is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. \\nBond polarities, then, must have the same vector properties as forces. \\n\\nAs we shall see in the next chapter, CO2 is a linear molecule, that is, all three \\natoms lie in a straight line (Figure 7.16). In a carbon dioxide molecule, each \\ncarbon–oxygen bond is polar because an oxygen atom is more electronegative \\nthan a carbon atom, but the bond polarities point in opposite directions be-\\ncause CO2 is a linear molecule.\\n\\nO C O\\n\\n Molecule Electronegativity difference Dipole moment/10–30 C·m*\\n\\n HF 1.9 6.36\\n\\n HCl 1.1 3.43\\n\\n HBr 0.9 2.63\\n\\n HI 0.6 1.27\\n\\nTABLE 7.4 The dipole moments of the gaseous hydrogen halides\\n\\n*The units of dipole moment are charge × distance, or coulombs × meters (C·m) in SI units.\\n\\n7-11.

A molecule with no net dipole moment is a nonpolar molecule.\\n\\nConversely, if we know the dipole moment experimentally, then we can  \\napply our representation to learn about the direction of the bonds. For exam-\\nple, because a CO2 molecule has no net dipole moment, the molecule must be \\nlinear.\\n\\nLet’s consider a H2O molecule as another example. The oxygen–hydrogen \\nbonds are polar because an oxygen atom is more electronegative than a hydro-\\ngen atom; we can illustrate this as\\n\\nH O H\\n\\nHowever, this diagram implies that water is a nonpolar molecule. In fact, a H2O \\nmolecule has a large dipole moment, so it is a polar molecule. The discrepancy \\nis due to our assumption that H2O is a linear molecule. We will see in the next \\nchapter that the water molecule is bent. The H–O–H bond angle is not 180°; \\nrather it is 104.5° (Figure 7.17). We can illustrate the bent structure by\\n\\nO\\n\\n104.5°\\n\\nHH\\n\\nThus, the net dipole moment in a H2O molecule has the orientation\\n\\nO\\nHH\\n\\nThere is an important lesson for us here. The Lewis formulas that we have \\nlearned to write in this chapter suggest only which atoms are bonded to which \\nin the molecule, not the spatial arrangement of the atoms. Although Lewis for-\\nmulas are very useful in this regard, they are not meant to indicate the three-\\ndimensional arrangement of the atoms in a molecule. In the next chapter we \\nlearn some simple, useful rules for predicting the shapes of molecules by using \\nLewis formulas.\\n\\nSummAry\\nA Lewis formula shows the arrangement of the valence electrons of the con-\\nstituent atoms in a molecule and suggests how these atoms are bonded to each \\nother. A covalent bond is represented as a pair of electrons shared between two \\natoms. The octet rule states that each element in a species forms covalent bonds \\nthat will give it eight electrons in its outer shell. The octet rule is especially use-\\nful for compounds involving carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine atoms. Two \\natoms may form a single bond, a double bond, or a triple bond between them in \\norder to satisfy the octet rule.\\n\\nThere are a number of exceptions to the octet rule. Hydrogen is almost \\nalways a terminal atom, requiring only two electrons. Species with an odd \\nnumber of electrons do not satisfy the octet rule and form free radicals.

Elements in the third and lower rows of the periodic table may \\nexpand their valence shell by using d orbitals to accommodate more than eight \\nelectrons in their outer shell.\\n\\nAnother aid for writing Lewis formulas is the assignment of formal charges \\nto the various atoms in a Lewis formula. The preferred Lewis formula has \\nthe lowest formal charge or the least separated formal charges. If there is a \\nchoice, negative formal charges should be placed on the more electronegative \\nelements and positive formal charges on the less electronegative elements in a \\nmolecule.\\n\\nWhen it is possible to write two or more Lewis formulas for a molecule with-\\nout altering the positions of the atoms, each individual formula is said to be \\na contributing form to a resonance hybrid. The actual bonding is best repre-\\nsented by an average, or a superposition, of the individual contributing forms, \\ncalled a resonance hybrid.\\n\\nMost chemical bonds are neither purely ionic nor purely covalent. A good \\nmeasure of the ionic character in a bond is determined from the electronega-\\ntivity difference between the atoms making up the bond. When the electro- \\nnegativities of the two atoms joined by a covalent bond are different, the bond \\nis said to be polar.\\n\\nLewis formulas indicate only the bonding within a molecule, not the shape \\nof a molecule.\\n\\nTErmS you ShouLD KNow\\nvalence electron 197\\ncovalent bond 198\\nLewis formula 198\\nlone electron pair 198\\nlone pair 198\\nmolecular crystal 198\\nbond length 198\\noctet rule 198\\norganic compound 205\\nformal charge 205\\ndouble bond 209\\ntriple bond 209\\n\\nresonance form 212\\nresonance 212\\nresonance hybrid 213\\ndelocalized bond 213\\nresonance energy 213\\nplanar molecule 215\\nresonance stabilization 216\\nfree radical 216\\nelectron-deficient compound 216\\nexpanded valence shell 218\\nelectronegativity 223\\npure covalent bond 224\\n\\nnonpolar bond 224\\npolar covalent bond 224\\npure ionic bond 224\\npartial charge, d 225\\npartial ionic character 225\\ndipole moment (C·m) 226\\nvector 227\\npolyatomic molecule 227\\nlinear molecule 227\\nnonpolar molecule 228\\npolar molecule 228\\n\\n                   \\n\\nAN EQuATioN you ShouLD KNow how To uSE 229\\n\\nAN EQuATioN you ShouLD KNow how To uSE\\n\\n                                                                                                              \\ue031                            \\ue032 = \\ue031                             \\ue032– \\ue031                      \\ue032 –  1  \\ue031                    \\ue032           \\n                                         \\n\\n2\\n\\n         \\n             \\n\\nformal charge\\non an atom in \\n\\na Lewis formula\\n\\ntotal number of\\nvalence electrons\\nin the free atom\\n\\ntotal number\\nof lone-pair\\n\\nelectrons\\n\\ntotal number\\nof shared\\nelectrons\\n\\n(7.1)   (calculation of formal charge)=\\nformal charge\\non an atom in\\n\\na Lewis formula�\\ntotal number of\\n\\nvalence electrons\\nin the free atom�� � –\\n\\ntotal number\\nof lone-pair\\n\\nelectrons� � –\\ntotal number\\n\\nof shared\\nelectrons� �1_2\\n\\n\\n\\n7.

Prediction of Molecular Geometries\\n\\nThe shapes of molecules play a major role in determining a wide variety of chemical properties, including chemical reactivity, odor, taste, and drug \\naction. In this chapter we devise a set of simple, systematic rules that allow us \\nto predict the shapes of thousands of molecules. These rules are based on the \\nLewis formulas that we developed in Chapter 7 and are collectively called the \\nvalence-shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory. In spite of its rather im-\\nposing name, VSEPR theory is easy to understand, easy to apply, and remark-\\nably reliable. We should perhaps emphasize here that we use these rules to pre-\\ndict the shapes of isolated molecules, such as molecules in the gas phase. The \\nshapes of molecules even in the solid phase, however, typically differ little from \\nthe predictions that we shall make here.\\n\\n8-1. Lewis Formulas Do Not Give Us the Shapes of Molecules\\n\\nLewis formulas show the bonding relationships among atoms in a molecule. \\nAlthough a Lewis formula shows the connectivity between atoms, it does not \\nshow us the shape or geometrical arrangement of the nuclei in the molecule. \\nConsider the molecule dichloromethane, CH2Cl2. One Lewis formula for di-\\nchloromethane is\\n\\nCl C\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\nI\\n\\nCl\\n\\nIf we infer from the Lewis formula that dichloromethane is flat, or planar, \\nthen we must conclude that the Lewis formula\\n\\nH C\\n\\nCl\\n\\nH\\nII\\n\\nCl\\n\\nrepresents a different geometry for dichloromethane. In formula I the two chlo-\\nrine atoms lie 180° apart, whereas in formula II they lie 90° apart.

Stereoisomers are different molecular species and therefore have differ-\\nent chemical and physical properties.\\n\\nTwo stereoisomers of a dichloromethane molecule have never been ob-\\nserved; there is only one kind of dichloromethane molecule. This finding sug-\\ngests that the four bonds are oriented such that there is only one distinct way \\nof bonding the two hydrogen atoms and the two chlorine atoms to the central \\ncarbon atom. Therefore, our assumption that dichloromethane is a planar mol-\\necule is incorrect.\\n\\nA geometric arrangement that shows why there are no geometric isomers of \\na dichloromethane molecule was reported independently in 1874 by the Dutch \\nchemist Jacobus H. van’t Hoff and the French chemist Joseph Le Bel. They pro-\\nposed that the four bonds about a central carbon atom in a molecule such as \\nmethane, CH4, or dichloromethane, CH2Cl2, are directed toward the vertices of \\na tetrahedron (Figure 8.1). A regular tetrahedron is a four-sided figure that has \\nfour equivalent vertices and four identical faces, each of which is an equilateral \\ntriangle (Figure 8.2). A molecule whose three-dimensional form is that of a tet-\\nrahedron is described as being tetrahedral in shape (we change the ending to \\nal to form the adjective). Cardboard models of tetrahedral molecules originally \\nmade by J. H. van’t Hoff are shown in Figure 8.3.\\n\\nWe shall see some examples of compounds that do form stereoisomers in \\nSection 8-10.\\n\\n8-2. all Four Vertices of a Regular tetrahedron are equivalent\\n\\nYou can verify from Figure 8.1b or by constructing a molecular model that the \\nfour vertices of a tetrahedron are equivalent and there is only one way of bond-\\ning two hydrogen atoms and two chlorine atoms directly to a central carbon \\natom. The tetrahedral model for a CH2Cl2 molecule is thus in accord with the \\nexperimental fact that dichloromethane has no isomers.\\n\\nFigure 8.1 (a) A ball-and-stick model \\nof a methane, CH4, molecule. Each \\ncarbon–hydrogen bond in a CH4 \\nmolecule points toward the vertex of a \\nregular tetrahedron. The positions of \\nall four hydrogen atoms are equivalent \\nby symmetry.

(b) A tetrahedron also can be viewed as derived from a cube by placing \\natoms at four of the eight vertices as shown, and then placing an atom in the center \\nof the cube. From this diagram you can derive the tetrahedral angle of 109.5° (see \\nProblem 8-80).\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/05/09\\n\\n008-001 (410)\\n\\nx\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)  \\n\\n(a) (b)\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/05/09\\n\\n008-002 (411)\\n\\nx\\n\\n\\n\\n8-3.

Such models give fairly accurate representations of the an-\\ngles between bonds and of the relative sizes of the atoms in molecules. A less \\nrealistic molecular model, but one in which the geometry is usually easier to \\nsee, is the ball-and-stick molecular model used in Figure 8.1.\\n\\nIn a tetrahedral molecule like methane, CH4, all the H–C–H bond angles \\nare equal to 109.5°, which is called the tetrahedral bond angle. The tetrahedral \\nbond angle of 109.5° is a direct consequence of the geometrical properties of a \\nregular tetrahedron. It is the angle between any two vertices of the tetrahedron \\nand a point located exactly in the center of the tetrahedron (Figure 8.5).\\n\\nA carbon atom that is bonded to four other atoms is called a tetravalent \\ncarbon atom. The hypothesis of van’t Hoff and Le Bel that the bonds of a tet-\\nravalent carbon atom are tetrahedrally oriented was the beginning of what is \\ncalled structural chemistry, the area of chemistry in which the shapes and sizes \\nof molecules are studied. Many experimental methods have been developed to \\ndetermine molecular geometries. Most of the methods involve the interaction \\nof electromagnetic radiation or electrons with molecules. Using such methods, \\nwe can measure bond lengths and bond angles in molecules and thereby de-\\ntermine molecular geometries, such as the tetrahedral structure of a CH2Cl2 \\nmolecule. It turns out that molecules occur in a fascinating variety of shapes. \\nWe noted in Chapter 7 that CO2 is a  linear molecule and that H2O is a bent \\nmolecule. We have also noted that CH4 is an example of a tetrahedral molecule. \\nSome examples of other molecular geometries are shown in Figure 8.6.\\n\\n8-3.  Valence-Shell electron-Pair Repulsion theory is  \\nUsed to Predict the Shapes of Molecules\\n\\nA simple theory proposed in 1957 by Ronald J. Gillespie and Sir Ronald S. Ny-\\nholm (Frontispiece) enables us to predict the shapes of molecules such as those \\nshown in Figure 8.6. The prediction method of the theory is based on the total \\nnumber of bonds and lone electron pairs in the valence shell of the central \\natom in a molecule. The key postulate of the theory is that the shape of a mol-\\necule is determined by minimizing the mutual repulsion of the electron pairs \\n\\nFigure 8.3 J.

For this reason, the theory is called the \\nvalence-shell electron-pair repulsion theory, or the VSEPR theory.\\n\\nConsider a beryllium chloride molecule, BeCl2, an electron-deficient com-\\npound. The Lewis formula for a BeCl2 molecule is\\n\\nCl Be Cl\\n\\nAlthough the central beryllium atom has no lone electron pairs, it does have \\ntwo covalent bonds and thus has two bonding electron pairs in its valence shell. \\nThese valence-shell electron pairs repel each other and can minimize their mu-\\ntual repulsion by being as far apart as possible. If we visualize the central beryl-\\nlium atom as a sphere and the two valence-shell electron pairs (the two covalent \\nbonds) as being on the surface of the sphere, then the two bonds minimize \\ntheir mutual repulsion by being at opposite poles of the sphere. Thus, the two \\nbonds are on opposite sides of the central beryllium atom, and the Cl–Be–Cl \\nbond angle is 180°. The shape of a molecule is characterized by the positions \\nof the atomic nuclei in the molecule, so we say that BeCl2 is a linear molecule. \\nThis prediction is in accord with experimental studies of BeCl2 molecules in the \\ngas phase. The positioning of the two valence-shell electron pairs on opposite \\nsides of the central atom is shown in Figure 8.7a. Note that we do not consider \\nthe valence electrons making up the lone pairs on the two chlorine atoms when \\ndetermining the shape of a BeCl2 molecule; we only consider the valence elec-\\n\\nFigure 8.6 The experimentally \\nobserved shapes of various molecules. \\nThe shading is added to help us \\nvisualize the molecular shape.\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/05/09\\n\\n008-006\\n\\n(412)\\n\\nT-shaped\\n\\nCl F\\n\\nS\\n\\nCl\\n\\nF F\\n\\nF\\n\\nS\\n\\nO\\n\\nTrigonal planar\\n\\nSquare planar\\n\\nXe\\n\\nTrigonal pyramidal\\n\\n H \\n\\nN\\n\\nSquare pyramidal\\n\\nI\\n\\nTrigonal bipyramidal\\n\\nP\\n\\nOctahedral \\n\\nx\\n\\n\\n\\ntrons directly attached to the central atom.

The five vertices of a trigonal bipyramid are not equivalent. The three ver-\\ntices lying on the equator in Figure 8.7d and Figure 8.8 are equivalent and are \\ncalled equatorial vertices; the two vertices lying at the polar axes are equivalent \\nand are called axial vertices. The axial vertices are not geometrically equiva-\\nlent to the equatorial vertices; and, as we will show, this nonequivalence has im-\\nportant structural consequences.

An \\nimportant property of a regular octahedron is that all six vertices are equiva-\\nlent.

Lone electron Pairs in the Valence Shell  \\naffect the Shapes of Molecules\\n\\nIn each case we have discussed so far, all the electron pairs in the valence shell \\nof the central atom have been in covalent bonds. Now let’s consider cases in \\nwhich there are lone pairs of electrons as well as covalent bonds in the valence \\nshell of the central atom. As an example, consider an ammonia, NH3, molecule. \\nThe Lewis formula for an NH3 molecule is\\n\\nH N\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nThere are four electron pairs in the valence shell of the nitrogen atom. \\nThree of them are in covalent bonds, and one is a lone pair. These four valence-\\nshell electron pairs mutually repel one another and, therefore, are directed \\ntoward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 8.10b). The three hydrogen atoms \\nform an equilateral triangle, and the nitrogen atom sits directly above the cen-\\nter of the plane of the triangle. Such a structure is called a triangular pyramid \\nor trigonal pyramid and an ammonia molecule is described as being trigo-\\nnal pyramidal in shape. An ammonia molecule is shaped like a tripod, with \\nthe three N–H bonds forming the legs of the tripod. A space-filling molecular \\nmodel of NH3 is shown in Figure 8.11. It is important to keep in mind that what \\nwe mean by the shape of a molecule, or the molecular shape, is defined by the \\npositions of the nuclei in the molecule because it is only the positions of these \\nnuclei that can be located in most methods used to experimentally determine \\nmolecular structures. The lone-pair electrons, on the other hand, are relatively \\ndiffuse and are generally not located in structural determinations.\\n\\nIf the four electron pairs in an NH3 molecule pointed to the corners of a \\nregular tetrahedron, then the H–N–H bond angles would be 109.5°. The four \\nelectron pairs in this case are not equivalent, however. Three of them occur in \\ncovalent bonds, and the fourth is a lone pair. Thus, we might expect some dis-\\ntortion from a regular tetrahedral geometry. Electron pairs in covalent bonds \\nare shared between two atoms and are localized between them. A lone pair \\nof electrons, on the other hand, is associated only with the central atom and \\ntherefore is not as localized as the pair of electrons in a covalent bond. Thus, \\na lone pair of electrons is more spread out, or bulkier, than a bonding pair of \\n\\n180°\\n\\n120°\\n\\n109.5°\\n\\n90°\\n\\n90°\\n\\n90°\\n\\n120°\\n\\nlinear\\n\\nShape Structure\\n\\ntrigonal\\nplanar\\n\\ntetrahedral\\n\\ntrigonal\\nbipyramidal\\n\\noctahedral\\n\\ntabLe 8.1 the bond angles associ-\\nated with shapes shown in Figure 8.7\\n\\n\\n\\nelectrons; consequently, a lone pair of electrons takes up more room around \\na central atom than a covalent bond does. This arrangement means that the \\nrepulsion between a lone pair of electrons and the electron pair in a covalent \\nbond is greater than the repulsion between the electron pairs in two adjacent \\ncovalent bonds. This effect causes the H–N–H bond angles in an NH3 molecule \\nto decrease slightly from the 109.5° regular tetrahedral angle to 107.3° (Figure \\n8.12). \\n\\nWe cannot predict quantitatively from VSEPR theory that the H–N–H bond \\nangles in an NH3 molecule are 107.3°, but we can predict that they are somewhat \\nless than the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5°. We say that VSEPR is a qualitative \\nrather than a quantitative theory. However, as a rough rule of thumb, applicable \\nwhenever C, N, or O are central atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement, each lone \\npair decreases the remaining bond angles involving adjacent atoms bonded to \\nthe central atom by about 2°.\\n\\nThe example of an NH3 molecule shows that it is the total number of elec-\\ntron pairs in the valence shell of the central atom that determines the geometry \\nof the nuclei in a molecule. As a second example, consider a water molecule. \\nThe Lewis formula for a H2O molecule is\\n\\nO\\nH H\\n\\nThe four valence-shell electron pairs on the oxygen atom in a water molecule \\nare directed toward the vertices of a tetrahedron (Figure 8.10c), so we see that \\nH2O is a bent or V-shaped molecule.\\n\\nThe two lone electron pairs take up more room around the oxygen atom \\nthan the two electron pairs in the covalent bonds, so we expect the repulsion \\nbetween the lone electron pairs to be greater than either that between a lone  \\nelectron pair and a covalent bond or that between two covalent bonds. We pre-\\ndict, then, that the H–O–H bond angle in a H2O molecule is less than the regu-\\nlar tetrahedral angle of 109.5° and that it is even smaller than the H–N–H bond \\nangle (107.3°) in an NH3 molecule. The experimentally measured bond angle \\nin a H2O molecule is 104.5°.\\n\\nEach of the molecules CH4, NH3, and H2O has four electron pairs in the \\nvalence shell of the central atom. The four electron pairs are directed roughly \\ntoward the corners of a tetrahedron, as shown in Figure 8.10. The shape of \\nthe molecule is described by giving the positions of the nuclei. Thus, a CH4 \\nmolecule is tetrahedral; an NH3 molecule is trigonal pyramidal; and a H2O \\nmolecule is bent.\\n\\nWe can classify molecules by introducing the following terminology.

Lone-Pair electrons occupy the equatorial Vertices  \\nof a trigonal bipyramid\\n\\nRecall that the five vertices of a trigonal bipyramid are not equivalent to one an-\\nother (Figure 8.7d and Figure 8.8). They form a set of three equivalent equato-\\nrial vertices and two equivalent axial vertices. Consequently, in considering the \\nclass of molecules designated by AX4E, for example, we have two nonequivalent \\nchoices for the position of the lone pair. We can place it at an equatorial vertex \\nor at an axial vertex.\\n\\nFigure 8.15a shows that an equatorial pair of electrons has only two nearest \\nneighbors at 90°, and Figure 8.15b shows that an axial electron pair has three \\nnearest neighbors at 90°.

Molecular Geometry Determines whether or Not  \\na Molecule has a Net Dipole Moment\\n\\nWe learned in Section 7-11 that although both bonds in a carbon dioxide mol-\\necule are polar, the molecule itself does not have a dipole moment. Because \\nCO2 is a linear molecule, the two polar bonds, which can be treated as vector \\nquantities, oppose each other exactly. Similar reasoning applies to a square \\nplanar molecule in which all four ligands are the same, such as xenon tetrafluo-\\nride. Although the four bonds in a XeF4 molecule are polar, the square planar \\ngeometry of the molecule\\n\\nyields no net dipole moment. These two examples show that even though a \\nmolecule has polar bonds, the symmetry of the molecule may cause it to have \\nno net dipole moment. In order for a molecule to have a net dipole moment, \\nit must meet two criteria: (1) it must have polar bonds (i.e., there must be an \\nelectronegativity difference between two or more of the atoms in the molecule), \\nand (2) the polar bonds must be asymmetric (i.e., their dipole moments must \\nnot cancel). Molecules with no net dipole moment are said to be nonpolar mol-\\necules. Some other examples of nonpolar molecules are\\n\\nFigure 8.22 (a) The geometry of a \\nxenon tetrafluoride molecule, XeF4, \\nwhich belongs to the class AX4E2. \\nThe two lone electron pairs occupy \\nopposite vertices of the octahedron, so \\nXeF4 is a planar molecule.

Structural isomers are chemically \\ndistinct species with their own unique physical and chemical properties.\\n\\nIn addition to structural isomers, it is also possible to form chemically dis-\\ntinct isomers by changing the spatial arrangement of the atoms without altering \\nthe atom-to-atom connectivity in a molecule.

The \\nshape of molecules also explains why certain chemical reactions proceed and \\nothers do not (as we shall see in Chapter 18). The VSEPR theory is simple and \\nuseful, and it correctly predicts the shapes of thousands of molecules and ions. \\nAs we mentioned earlier, VSEPR is a qualitative theory, in that it does not in all \\ncases predict precise numerical values of bond angles. Also, it cannot be used \\nto predict bond lengths. Although the theory cannot predict that the H–N–H \\nbond angles in an NH3 molecule are 107.3°, it can predict that they are slightly \\nless than the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5°. However, VSEPR theory fails to \\npredict correctly the bond angle in a H2Se molecule, which is approximately \\n90°, or the H–P–H bond angles in a PH3 molecule, which also are approximately \\n90°. Although such exceptions are rare, it is a good idea to keep them in mind \\nwhen applying VSEPR theory.\\n\\nSUMMaRy\\nThe valence-shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory is used to predict \\nthe shapes of molecules and ions in which there is a central atom bonded to \\nligands. Molecular shapes are defined by the arrangements of the nuclei. How-\\never, VSEPR theory takes into account all the valence-shell electrons, including \\nlone pairs, to predict the geometrical arrangement of the ligands around the \\ncentral atom. The theory is based on the premise that the valence-shell elec-\\ntron pairs around a central atom arrange themselves to minimize their mutual \\nrepulsion. The procedure for using VSEPR theory to predict molecular shapes \\ncan be summarized as follows:\\n\\n 1.   Use the Lewis formula to determine the class, AXmEn, to which the mol-\\necule or ion belongs, where A represents a central atom, X represents a \\nligand atom, and E represents a lone pair of electrons.\\n\\n 2.   Given the class AXmEn to which the molecule or ion belongs, use Table 8.2 \\nto predict its shape, along with electronegativity differences to predict its \\npolarity.\\n\\nLone pairs of electrons and multiple bonds have a larger spatial require-\\nment than bonded pairs and produce small distortions of the molecular geom-\\netry from regular geometric shapes.\\n\\nA polar bond results when the two atoms in the bond have different elec-\\ntronegativities. The molecular geometry of a molecule with polar bonds deter-\\nmines whether or not the molecule has a net dipole movement.\\n\\nChemicals that share the same formula but that have different connectivity \\n\\nSUMMaRy 259\\n\\n\\n\\n8.

He attended Oregon State University, where \\nhe also taught various chemistry classes as an undergraduate student. His future wife was a student in \\nhis chemistry class for home economics majors. He received his Ph.D. in chemistry in 1925 from the \\nCalifornia Institute of Technology for his dissertation on X-ray crystallography of organic compounds \\nand the structure of crystals. After spending a year studying at the University of Munich, he joined the \\nfaculty at the California Institute of Technology, where he remained for almost 40 years. Pauling was \\na pioneer in the application of quantum theory to chemistry. His book The Nature of the Chemical Bond \\n(1939) is one of the most influential chemistry texts of the twentieth century. In the 1930s, he became \\ninterested in biological molecules and developed a structural theory of protein molecules—work that \\nled to elucidating that sickle cell anemia is caused by a faulty structure of hemoglobin. In the early \\n1950s, he proposed the alpha helix as the basic structure of proteins. Pauling was awarded the Nobel \\nPrize in Chemistry in 1954 “for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to \\nthe elucidation of the structure of complex structures.” During the 1950s, Pauling was in the forefront \\nof the fight against nuclear testing, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1963. From \\nthe early 1980s until his death, he was embroiled in the controversy of advocating the use of vitamin C \\nas protection against the common cold and some serious maladies such as cancer. Pauling is the only \\nperson to have been awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes.\\n\\n\\n\\n267\\n\\n9. Covalent Bonding\\n\\nAs we have seen, the sharing of electrons between two atoms results in a cova-  lent bond. We used this information to draw Lewis formulas, and along \\nwith VSEPR theory, to infer molecular shapes. However, we did not quantita-\\ntively explain why such bonds form in the first place. To answer this, we need \\na more fundamental theory of covalent bonding. We showed in Chapter 5 how \\nquantum theory describes the electrons in atoms in terms of atomic orbit-\\nals. Now we shall use quantum theory to show how molecular orbitals may be \\nformed by combining atomic orbitals on different atoms. Recall from Chapter \\n5 that an orbital is just a special type of wave function. We shall use the two \\nterms interchangeably throughout this chapter. In the first few sections, we in-\\ntroduce molecular orbital theory and use it to describe the bonding in simple \\nhomonuclear diatomic molecules (in which the two atoms are the same) and \\nheteronuclear diatomic molecules (in which the two atoms are different). We \\nthen go on to discuss polyatomic molecules. To describe the bonding in poly-\\natomic molecules, we shall use special orbitals called hybrid orbitals that are \\ncombinations of atomic orbitals on the same atom and are constructed with \\nthe geometry of the molecule in mind. A nice feature of using hybrid orbitals \\nto describe the bonding in polyatomic molecules is that the bonding is closely \\nrelated to the Lewis formulas that we learned in Chapter 7. Following this chap-\\nter, we shall use our knowledge of molecular shape, structure, and orbitals to \\nunderstand the physical properties of molecules and chemical reactivity.\\n\\n9-1.  A Molecular Orbital Is a Combination of  \\nAtomic Orbitals on Different Atoms\\n\\nThe simplest neutral molecule is diatomic hydrogen, H2, which has only two \\nelectrons. The Schrödinger equation (Section 5-1) that describes the motion of \\nthe electrons in H2 can be solved to a high degree of accuracy using a computer. \\nThe results are valuable because they are similar to the results for more compli-\\ncated molecules. Let’s look at the approach of quantum theory in more detail.\\n\\nAs a first step in setting up the Schrödinger equation for a H2 molecule, \\nthe two nuclei are fixed at some given separation. Then the two electrons are \\nincluded, and the equation is solved to give the wave functions and energies \\nthat describe the two electrons.

We see that at large separations the two atoms hardly interact, so the \\nelectron density is just that of two electrons, each in a 1s orbital about each of \\nthe two hydrogen atoms. As the separation decreases, however, the two 1s orbit-\\nals overlap and combine into one orbital that is distributed around both nuclei. \\nSuch an orbital is called a molecular orbital because it extends over both nuclei \\nin the molecule. Throughout this chapter, we shall build molecular orbitals by \\ncombining atomic orbitals on different atoms. When electrons occupy these \\norbitals, the buildup of electron density between the nuclei results in a covalent \\nbond. Note how the detailed quantum theoretical results shown in Figure 9.1 \\ncorrespond to the Lewis formula; both approaches picture a covalent bond as \\nthe sharing of an electron pair between two nuclei.\\n\\nThe lower part of Figure 9.1 shows the energies that correspond to the elec-\\ntron densities. Notice that interaction energies are negative for any distances at \\nwhich the atoms attract each other. These negative values mean that the energy \\nof a H–H bond is less than that of two separated hydrogen atoms, which in turn \\nmeans that a H2 molecule is more stable than two isolated hydrogen atoms un-\\nder these conditions. The graph shows that, for a H2 molecule, the interaction \\nenergy has a minimum at the internuclear separation R  = 74 pm. This value of \\nR  is the predicted length of a H2 bond and is in excellent agreement with the \\nexperimental value.\\n\\n9-2.  the Hydrogen Molecular Ion H2+ Is the \\nSimplest Diatomic Species\\n\\nIn this section we discuss a theory of bonding, called molecular orbital theory, \\nthat gives us insight into why, for example, two hydrogen atoms join to form a \\nstable molecule, whereas two helium atoms do not. Although molecular orbital \\ntheory can be applied to all molecules, for simplicity we shall begin by consider-\\ning only homonuclear diatomic molecules (diatomic molecules in which both \\nnuclei are the same).\\n\\nRecall that we describe the electronic structure of atoms in terms of atomic \\norbitals, which are based on the set of orbitals that were given for a hydrogen \\natom. Because a hydrogen atom has only one electron, its atomic orbitals are \\nrelatively simple to calculate from the Schrödinger equation and serve as ap-\\nproximate orbitals for more complicated atoms.

At large \\nseparations, as in (a), the two orbitals appear simply as those of two separate atoms. As the atoms come together, the two separate \\natomic orbitals combine into one molecular orbital encompassing both nuclei, as in (b) through (h). The lower part of the figure \\nshows the energy of two hydrogen atoms as a function of their separation R. The labels (a) through (h) correspond to those in \\nthe upper part of the figure. At large distances, the two hydrogen atoms do not interact, so their interaction energy is zero. As the \\ntwo atoms come together, they attract each other, and so their interaction energy becomes negative. When they are less than  \\n74 pm apart, the interaction energy increases and they repel each other. The bond length of a H2 molecule is the distance at \\nwhich the energy is a minimum, that is, 74 pm. The energy at this distance is –0.724 aJ, which is the energy required to dissociate \\nthe H2 molecule into two separate hydrogen atoms.\\n\\n\\n\\n269\\n\\nplies to homonuclear diatomic molecules is the hydrogen molecular ion, H2+, \\nwhich consists of two protons and one electron. The H2+ ion can be produced ex-\\nperimentally by using H2(g) in a discharge tube (see Figure 2.18). It is a stable \\nspecies, with a bond length of 106 pm and a bond energy of 0.423 aJ.\\n\\nThe Schrödinger equation for a H2+ ion, like that for a hydrogen atom, is rel-\\natively easy to solve, and we obtain a set of wave functions, or orbitals, and their \\ncorresponding energies. As noted earlier, these orbitals extend over both nuclei \\nin H2+ and therefore are called molecular orbitals. In Chapter 5 we discussed the \\nshapes of the various hydrogen atomic orbitals and then used them to build up \\nthe electronic structures of more complicated atoms. In the same way, we now \\nuse the various H2+ molecular orbitals to build up the electronic structures of \\nmore complicated diatomic molecules.\\n\\nFigure 9.2 shows the shapes of the first few molecular orbitals of H2+.

We \\nshall explain the notation that we use to designate these orbitals (s1s, p*2py, for \\nexample) as we go along.\\n\\nQuantum chemists (chemists who apply quantum theory to molecules) \\nhave discovered that all the orbitals in Figure 9.2 can be generated by the addi-\\ntion or subtraction of orbitals on neighboring atoms. For example, the lowest \\nH2+ molecular orbital shown in Figure 9.2 can be generated by adding 1s orbitals \\non the two hydrogen atoms, much like that depicted in Figure 9.1. The resultant \\nconcentration of electronic charge between the nuclei tends to draw the nuclei \\ntogether and is responsible for the bond in the ground electronic state of a H2+\\n\\nmolecular ion. Such a molecular orbital is called a bonding orbital. This orbital \\nhas a circular cross section along the internuclear axis, the axis or line drawn \\nbetween the nuclei of the two bonding atoms. Because atomic s orbitals have a \\ncircular cross section (Figure 5.3), molecular orbitals that have a circular cross \\nsection along the internuclear axis are called \\ue073 orbitals (sigma, s, is the Greek \\nletter corresponding to s). Furthermore, because this orbital is constructed \\nfrom two hydrogen 1s orbitals, it is called a s1s orbital. Thus, we see that the \\nground state orbital of a H2+ ion is a s1s orbital.\\n\\nThe next orbital in Figure 9.2, the one of second-lowest energy, can be gener-\\nated by subtracting 1s orbitals on the hydrogen atoms. The resultant molecular \\norbital is also symmetric about the internuclear axis, and so is also a s orbital. \\nHowever, it is different from the ground state s1s orbital in that it has a nodal plane \\nmidway between the nuclei and perpendicular to the internuclear axis. (Re-\\ncall from Chapter 5 that surfaces on which an orbital has a value of zero are \\ncalled nodal surfaces.) The electrons in this orbital are concentrated on the far \\nsides of the two nuclei and therefore tend to draw the nuclei away from each \\nother. Such an orbital is called an antibonding orbital. To distinguish this anti-\\nbonding orbital from the bonding orbital, we denote the antibonding orbital \\nby s*1s. Figure 9.3 is a pictorial description of the formation of the s1s orbital \\nand the s*1s orbital by the addition and the subtraction of 1s orbitals on the \\nhydrogen atoms. Note that the orbitals in Figure 9.3 look like the two lowest \\norbitals in Figure 9.2, justifying the process of constructing molecular orbitals \\nby the addition and subtraction of atomic orbitals. Recall from Chapter 5 that \\nthe square of a wave function gives the probability of where the electron will \\nbe found, and so the buildup of the molecular orbital between the nuclei cor-\\nresponds to the electron density being accumulated there, which results in a \\nchemical bond. When the 1s orbitals are subtracted, however, they cancel each \\nother midway between the nuclei, giving the results for the molecular orbital \\nshown in the upper drawing in Figure 9.3. This cancellation leads to a region in \\nwhich the electron is unlikely to be found and thus a nodal plane between the \\nnuclei. The resulting molecular orbital in this case is an antibonding orbital. \\nFigure 9.4 shows the potential energies associated with these orbitals as a func-\\ntion of the internuclear distance, the distance between the two atomic nuclei. \\nAs in Figure 9.1, the minimum in the potential energy curve of the s1s orbital in \\nFigure 9.4 depicts the formation of a bond (a bonding orbital), and the absence \\nof a minimum in the potential energy curve of the s*1s orbital (an antibonding \\norbital) reflects the fact that the two hydrogen atoms in this case repel each \\nother. Finally, Figure 9.5 is a schematic illustration of an energy diagram for \\nthe formation of the s1s and s*1s orbitals.

Even though a ground state hydrogen atom does \\nnot have electrons in these orbitals, they still are used for excited states and we \\ncan use their combinations mathematically. Just as in the case of combining 1s \\norbitals, we can add and subtract 2s orbitals to form a bonding orbital and an \\nantibonding orbital. These molecular orbitals also have cylindrical symmetry \\nand thus are s orbitals. In fact, they look much like s1s orbitals, except they are \\nlarger in extent. Because they are formed from 2s orbitals, they are designated \\nby s2s and s*2s .\\n\\nWe can also combine 2p atomic orbitals on the hydrogen atoms. Recall that \\nthere are three 2p orbitals, directed along three perpendicular axes. As Figure \\n9.6 indicates, we can combine one pair of 2p orbitals along the internuclear axis \\n(which we shall arbitrarily call the z axis), while the other 2p orbitals (oriented \\nalong the x and y axes) are combined perpendicular to the internuclear axis. \\nLet’s consider the combination along the internuclear axis (the z axis) first. \\nFigure 9.7 focuses on this combination. In this figure we have labeled one of \\nthe lobes of each 2p orbital with a positive sign (+) and the other with a negative \\nsign (–) to indicate the regions in which the wave function has positive and neg-\\native values. In Figure 9.7a, the 2pz orbitals are combined in such a way that their \\npositive lobes overlap, resulting in a molecular orbital in which the electronic \\ncharge is concentrated between the two nuclei, thus forming a bonding orbital. \\nIt is a s orbital because it is cylindrically symmetric about the internuclear axis, \\nand we denote it by s2pz to convey that it is formed from the two 2pz orbitals.

Thus, the 2p orbitals directed along the x and y axes in \\nFigure 9.6 lead to a pair of p2p orbitals (p2px  and p2py) having the same energy and \\na pair of p*2p orbitals (p*2px  and p\\n\\n*\\n2py) having the same energy, as shown in Figure \\n\\n9.2. Each pair of molecular orbitals is, therefore, doubly degenerate. (Recall \\nfrom Chapter 5 that two or more orbitals that have the same energy are said to \\nbe degenerate.) In the case of a H2+ ion, the energy of the doubly degenerate \\np2p orbitals lies below that of the s2pz molecular orbital, which in turn lies below \\nthat of the doubly degenerate p*2p molecular orbitals, and these lie below the s*2pz \\nmolecular orbital as shown in Figure 9.2.\\n\\nJust as a hydrogen atom has atomic orbitals of ever-increasing energy, a H2+ \\nion has molecular orbitals of higher energy than those presented here as well. \\nHowever, we require only those shown in Figure 9.2 for our subsequent discus-\\nsion of diatomic molecules from the second row of the periodic table. Again, \\nkeep in mind that all the molecular orbitals shown in Figure 9.2 come in bond-\\ning-antibonding pairs. Thus, we have both a s1s and a s*1s orbital, a s2s and a s*2s \\norbital, and so on.\\n\\nBefore we leave this section, we should comment on one thing. We have \\ntaken combinations of two 1s orbitals, two 2s orbitals, and various 2p orbitals \\nto construct molecular orbitals. We never took a combination of a 1s and a 2s \\norbital, for example. The reason for this is that only orbitals of similar ener-\\ngies combine effectively. There is nothing wrong with taking combinations of \\norbitals of different energies; they just don’t contribute significantly to the final \\nresult. Similarly, we did not consider combinations of orbitals such as 2px and 2pz \\nbecause they also do not combine effectively.\\n\\n9-2. tHe HyDrOgen MOLeCuLAr IOn H2+ IS tHe SIMPLeSt DIAtOMIC SPeCIeS 273\\n\\nFigure 9.8 The combination of 2p \\norbitals that lie perpendicular to \\nthe internuclear axis.

As in the atomic case, each of these molecular orbitals \\nis occupied by a maximum of two electrons, in accord with the Pauli exclusion \\nprinciple. The hydrogen molecule, H2, has two electrons. According to the Pauli \\nexclusion principle, we place two electrons of opposite spins in the s1s orbital \\nand write the electron configuration of a H2 molecule as (s1s)2. The ground \\nstate electron configuration of a H2 molecule is illustrated in Figure 9.9, where, \\nfor simplicity, only the first two energy levels are shown. The two electrons in \\nthe bonding orbital constitute the single bond of a H2 molecule.\\n\\nWhat about the possibility of a He2 molecule, which would have four elec-\\ntrons? According to our procedure, two of the electrons of a He2 molecule \\nshould occupy the s1s orbital and two should occupy the s *1s orbital (Figure \\n9.10). Thus, we place two electrons in a bonding orbital and two in an antibond-\\ning orbital. Electrons in a bonding orbital tend to draw the nuclei together, \\nwhereas electrons in an antibonding orbital tend to draw the nuclei away from \\neach other. The two effects cancel, and so we predict there should be no net \\nbonding, which is the case under normal conditions (Table 9.1).\\n\\nTo make our theory more quantitative, we can define a quantity called bond \\norder by the equation\\n\\nbond order  =\\n2\\n\\nnumber of\\nelectrons in\\n\\nbonding orbitals� �\\nnumber of\\nelectrons in\\n\\nantibonding orbitals� �–\\n \\n\\n(9.1)\\n\\nA bond order of ½ indicates a one-electron bond (one-half of an electron \\npair); a bond order of 1 indicates a single bond (one pair of electrons); a bond \\norder of 2 indicates a double bond (two pairs of electrons); and so on. Table 9.1 \\nsummarizes the properties of the molecular species, H2+, H2, He2+, and He2. The \\nbond order of 0 for a He2 molecule indicates that two helium atoms do not form \\na stable covalent bond under normal conditions. Note from Table 9.1 that bond \\nlengths decrease and bond energies increase with increasing bond order. Thus, \\nbond order is also a qualitative measure of bond strength.\\n\\nSpecies Number of Ground state Bond      Bond   Bond\\n   electrons  configuration  order  length/pm  energy/aJ\\n\\n H2\\n+ 1 (s1s)1 ½ 106 0.423\\n\\n H2 2 (s1s)2 1 74 0.724\\n\\n He2\\n+ 3 (s1s)2(s*1s)1 ½ 108 0.400\\n\\n He2 4 (s1s)2(s*1s)2 0 not observed not observed\\n\\ntABLe 9.1 Molecular properties of H2+, H2, He2+, and He2\\n\\nEn\\ner\\n\\ngy\\n\\n1σ*\\n\\n1σ\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n05/29/09\\n\\n009-012 (443)\\n\\nEn\\ner\\n\\ngy\\n\\n1σ*\\n\\n1σ\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n05/29/09\\n\\n009-011 (443)\\n\\nFigure 9.9 A pictorial representation \\nof the electron configuration of a H2 \\nmolecule.

Molecular Orbital theory Predicts  \\nthe electron Configurations of Diatomic Molecules\\n\\nWhen we wrote electron configurations for multielectron atoms in Chapter 5, \\nwe used the ordering of the energies of the atomic orbitals shown in Figures \\n5.11 and 5.12. Recall that the order of the energies of the orbitals for multielec-\\ntron atoms does not follow the order of the energies of the hydrogen atomic \\norbitals. For instance, the energy of the 4s orbital is less than that of the 3d orbit-\\nals for multielectron atoms. A similar thing happens when we use the H2+ mo-\\nlecular orbitals that we have constructed from the combination of hydrogen \\natomic orbitals. The ordering of the molecular orbitals shown in Figure 9.2  \\ncan be used for the homonuclear diatomic molecules H2 through N2, that is, for \\nZ = 1 through Z = 7 (recall from Chapter 2 that Z  is the atomic number or \\nnumber of protons in an atom). However, for Z > 7, the s2p and p2p orbitals in-\\nterchange energies so that the energy of the s2p orbital is less than that of the \\np2p orbitals. The ordering of the energies of the molecular orbitals that we use \\nto write electron configuration of the second-row homonuclear diatomic mole-\\ncules Li2 through Ne2 is shown in Figure 9.11. Observe that the order of the s2p \\nand p2p orbitals changes in going from N2 to O2 molecules. Figure 9.11 is, in a \\nsense, the homonuclear diatomic molecule analog of Figures 5.11 and 5.12 for \\nmultielectron atoms. We have already discussed the homonuclear molecules H2 \\nthrough He2, so now we’ll use Figure 9.11 to write electron configurations for \\nthe homonuclear diatomic molecules Li2 through Ne2 and use these electron \\nconfigurations to discuss the bonding in these molecules.\\n\\nLithium vapor contains diatomic lithium molecules, Li2. A lithium atom \\nhas three electrons, so a Li2 molecule has a total of six electrons. In the ground \\nstate of a Li2 molecule, the six electrons occupy the lowest molecular orbitals \\nshown in Figure 9.11, in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle. The ground \\nstate electron configuration of a Li2 molecule is (s1s)2(s *1s)2(s 2s)2. There are \\nfour bonding electrons and two antibonding electrons, so the bond order is 1 \\n\\n9-4.

We use the \\nfull notation only when we need \\nto denote specific electron \\nconfigurations.\\n\\n\\n\\noxygen is weakly attracted to a region between the poles of a magnet (Figure \\n9.12). Most substances are diamagnetic, meaning that they are slightly repelled \\nby a magnetic field. Let’s see how the paramagnetism of O2(g) is related to its \\nelectron structure.\\n\\nEach oxygen atom has eight electrons; thus, an O2 molecule has a total of \\n16 electrons. When the 16 electrons are placed according to the molecular or-\\nbital diagram given in Figure 9.11, the last two go into the p *2p orbitals. As in the \\natomic case, we apply Hund’s rule (Section 5.8). Because the two p *2p orbitals \\nhave the same energy, we place one electron in each p *2p orbital such that the \\ntwo electrons have unpaired spins, as shown in Figure 9.11. The ground state \\nelectron configuration of an O2 molecule is (s1s)2(s *1s)2(s2s)2(s *2s)2(s2p)2(p2p)4\\n\\n(p *2px)\\n1(p *2py)\\n\\n1. According to Hund’s rule, each p *2p orbital is occupied by one elec-\\ntron and the spins are unpaired. Therefore, an oxygen molecule has a net elec-\\ntron spin and so acts like a tiny magnet. Thus, O2(g) is attracted into a region \\nbetween the poles of a magnet (Figure 9.12).\\n\\nThe amount of oxygen in air can be monitored by measuring its para-\\nmagnetism. Because oxygen is the only major component of air that is para-\\nmagnetic, the measured paramagnetism of air is directly proportional to the \\namount of oxygen present. Linus Pauling (Frontispiece) developed a method \\nusing the paramagnetism of oxygen to monitor oxygen levels in submarines \\nand airplanes in World War II. A similar method is still used by physicians to \\nmonitor the oxygen content in blood during anesthesia.\\n\\nThe Lewis formula of an O2 molecule does not account for the paramagnet-\\nism of O2(g). According to the octet rule, we should write the Lewis formula \\nof an O2 molecule as O O  , but this formula implies incorrectly that all the \\nelectrons are paired. The oxygen molecule is an exception to the utility of Lewis \\nformulas, whereas the more fundamental molecular orbital theory is able to \\naccount successfully for the distribution of the electrons in molecular oxygen.\\n\\nTable 9.2 gives the ground state electron configurations of the homonuclear \\ndiatomic molecules Li2 through Ne2.\\n\\nFigure 9.12 Liquid oxygen is attracted \\nto the magnetic field between the \\npoles of a magnet because oxygen \\nis paramagnetic.

In doing so we construct molecular orbit-\\nals this time by combining atomic orbitals from all the atoms in the molecule. \\nThen, using the corresponding energy-level diagram, we place electrons into \\nthe molecular orbitals in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle. Because \\nmolecular orbitals are combinations of atomic orbitals from all the atoms in a \\npolyatomic molecule, they are often spread over the entire molecule. Rather \\nthan use molecular orbital theory as we have described it for diatomic mol-\\necules, however, we shall use a simplified approach which recognizes that many \\nchemical bonds have properties such as bond lengths, bond angles, and bond \\nenergies that are fairly constant from molecule to molecule. For example, the \\ncarbon-hydrogen bond lengths in many molecules are about 110 pm and their \\nbond energies are a little greater than 0.7 aJ. A large amount of experimental \\ndata such as these suggests that the bonding in most polyatomic molecules can \\nbe analyzed in terms of orbitals that are localized between pairs of bonded \\natoms.\\n\\nConsider the methane molecule, CH4, in which each hydrogen atom is \\njoined to the central carbon atom by a covalent bond. As Figure 9.14 suggests, \\nthe bonding electrons, and hence the orbitals that describe them, are localized \\nalong the line joining each hydrogen atom to the central carbon atom. These \\nelectrons are said to occupy localized bond orbitals, and each pair of electrons \\nthat occupies a localized bond orbital is said to constitute a localized covalent \\nbond. Note the similarity between this bonding picture in a CH4 molecule and \\nits Lewis formula.\\n\\nH C\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\nmethane\\n\\nH H C\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\nethane\\n\\nHC\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nThe simplest neutral polyatomic molecule is BeH2. Beryllium hydride is an \\nelectron-deficient compound. Its Lewis formula, H–Be–H, does not satisfy the \\noctet rule. According to VSEPR theory, beryllium hydride is a symmetric linear \\nmolecule; the two Be–H bonds are 180° apart and are equivalent. Therefore, we \\nmust form two equivalent bond orbitals that are localized along the molecular \\nH–Be–H axis.\\n\\nIn order to describe the bonding in a BeH2 molecule and many other poly-\\natomic molecules, we introduce the idea of a hybrid orbital. We define a hybrid \\norbital as a combination of atomic orbitals of the same atom. In the case of BeH2, \\nwe consider combinations of the valence atomic orbitals on a beryllium atom, \\nnamely, the 2s and the 2p orbitals (Figure 9.15).

It turns out that it is possible to combine the 2s and one of the \\n2p orbitals to produce such orbitals by adding and subtracting the two atomic \\norbitals as we did when forming molecular orbitals.\\n\\nFigure 9.16 illustrates the formation of two hybrid orbitals from a 2s and a \\n2p orbital. As we see from Figure 9.16, there is a buildup of the hybrid orbital \\nwhere the values of the combining 2s and 2p orbitals have the same signs and \\npartial cancellation where they have opposite signs. Figure 9.16 shows that one \\nof our hybrid orbitals is directed toward the right (as drawn) and that the other \\nhas the same shape but is directed toward the left (as drawn).\\n\\nThese two hybrid orbitals on the beryllium atom are called sp orbitals be-\\ncause they are formed from the 2s orbital and one of the 2p orbitals. The sp \\norbitals have two important features: (1) each one provides a large region to \\ncombine with a hydrogen 1s orbital (the positive region in Figure 9.16), and (2) \\nthey are 180° apart. The two empty 2p orbitals that are not used to form the sp \\nhybrid orbitals are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the line \\nformed by the sp hybrid orbitals (Figure 9.17).\\n\\nWe now form two covalent bond orbitals by combining each sp hybrid orbital \\nwith a hydrogen 1s atomic orbital. As shown in Figure 9.18, these are s-bond \\norbitals. Each is localized between the beryllium atom and a hydrogen atom, \\nand they are 180° apart. Recall from Section 9.2 that the H2+ molecular orbit-\\nals occur as bonding and antibonding pairs. Similarly, when each beryllium sp \\norbital overlaps with a hydrogen 1s orbital, a s-bonding orbital and a s*-anti-\\nbonding orbital results. The two s*-antibonding orbitals have much higher en-\\nergies than the s-bonding orbitals, so they are not used in the bonding of a \\nBeH2 molecule in the ground state. Thus, they are not indicated in Figure 9.18. \\nIf we consider only molecules in their ground states, we can ignore the higher-\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/17/09\\n\\n009-017\\n\\nx\\n\\ny\\n\\nz\\n\\ny\\n\\ny\\n\\ny\\n\\nz\\n\\nx\\n\\nz\\n\\nz\\n\\nx\\n\\nx\\n\\n2s orbital\\n\\n2p orbital\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\nx\\n\\nFigure 9.16 The formation of two sp hybrid orbitals from a 2s and a \\n2p atomic orbital oriented along the bonding axis.

Hybrid Atomic Orbitals Can Involve d Orbitals\\n\\nIn Chapter 8 we learned about molecules that are trigonal bipyramidal (for \\nexample, phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5) and octahedral (for example, sul-\\nfur hexafluoride, SF6). The central atom in each of these molecules has an ex-\\npanded valence shell, and one way of describing the bonding in such molecules \\nis to include d orbitals in the construction of hybrid orbitals.\\n\\nA combination of a 3s orbital, three 3p orbitals, and one 3d orbital gives five \\nhybrid atomic orbitals that have trigonal bipyramidal symmetry (Figure 9.30). \\nThese five sp3d orbitals are interesting because they are not equivalent to one \\nanother. In fact, there are two sets of orbitals: a set of three equivalent equato-\\nrial orbitals and a set of two equivalent axial orbitals. This result is consistent \\nwith the experimental fact that the five chlorine atoms in a PCl5 molecule are \\nnot equivalent (Section 8.4). The five phosphorus–chlorine s-bond orbitals \\nare formed by combining each phosphorus sp3d hybrid orbital with a half-filled \\nchlorine 3p orbital. Ten of the valence electrons (five from the phosphorus atom \\nand one from each of the chlorine atoms) occupy the five localized bond orbit-\\nals (two electrons in each orbital) to form the five localized covalent bonds.\\n\\nTo describe the bonding in the octahedral SF6 molecule, we need six equiv-\\nalent hybrid orbitals on the sulfur atom that point toward the vertices of an \\noctahedron. This arrangement can be achieved by combining the 3s orbital, the \\nthree 3p orbitals, and two of the 3d orbitals on the sulfur atom. The resulting six \\nsp3d2 orbitals point toward the vertices of a regular octahedron (Figure 9.31). \\nThe six sulfur–fluorine s-bond orbitals in a SF6 molecule are formed by com-\\nbining each sulfur sp3d 2 orbital with a fluorine 2p orbital. Twelve of the valence \\nelectrons (six from the sulfur atom and one from each of the fluorine atoms) \\noccupy the six localized bond orbitals to form the six localized covalent bonds.\\n\\nFor the PCl5 and SF6 molecules, we use 3s, 3p, and some of the 3d orbitals \\non the central atom to form hybrid atomic orbitals. As we pointed out earlier, \\nquantum theory tells us that only orbitals of similar energy combine effectively. \\nIn other words, we can combine the 3s, 3p, and 3d orbitals because they have \\nsimilar energies. The combination of 3d orbitals with 2s and 2p orbitals does \\nnot produce hybrid orbitals that are effective in forming bonds because the 3d \\norbitals are much higher in energy than the 2s or 2p orbitals are. This restric-\\ntion explains why only elements in the third and higher rows of the periodic \\ntable can expand their valence shells, as we saw in Chapter 7. For example, for \\natoms of elements such as phosphorus and sulfur, which have valence electrons \\nthat occupy the 3s and 3p orbitals, we can use their 3d orbitals to expand their \\nvalence shells, but for atoms of second-row elements such as carbon and nitro-\\ngen, which have valence electrons that occupy the 2s and 2p orbitals, we cannot \\nuse 3d orbitals to form hybrid orbitals.\\n\\nTable 9.3 summarizes the hybrid atomic orbitals that we have introduced. \\n\\n9-9.

COvALent BOnDIng292\\n\\nThe first step is to join the two carbon atoms by combining an sp2 orbital \\nfrom each, as shown in Figure 9.32. The resulting carbon–carbon bond orbital \\nis a s-bond orbital. There are (2 × 4) + (4 × 1) = 12 valence electrons in an \\nethylene molecule. Two of these valence electrons occupy the carbon–carbon \\ns-bond orbital to form a carbon–carbon s bond. The four hydrogen atoms are \\nbonded, two to each carbon atom, by combining the 1s atomic orbitals on the \\nhydrogen atoms with the four remaining sp2 orbitals on the carbon atoms, as \\nshown in Figure 9.33. These four carbon–hydrogen s-bond orbitals are occu-\\npied by eight of the valence electrons to form four carbon–hydrogen s bonds. \\nAll five bonds formed so far are s bonds, and Figure 9.33 shows the \\ue073-bond \\nframework in an ethylene molecule.\\n\\nRecall that there is a 2p atomic orbital on each carbon atom perpendicu-\\nlar to each H–C–H plane (Figure 9.32). If the two ends of the molecule are \\noriented such that these two 2p orbitals are parallel, then their overlap is maxi-\\nmized and the p orbital illustrated in Figure 9.34 results. This p orbital is oc-\\ncupied by the remaining two valence electrons to form a p bond. Note that \\nthe positive and negative lobes of a p bond are formed from the positive and \\nnegative lobes of the two p orbitals from which it is formed. Consequently, the \\ntwo lobes taken together represent one  p bond. The double bond in an ethylene \\nmolecule is described by the s bond and the p bond, as shown in Figure 9.34. \\nThus, we have four C(sp2) + H(1s) s bonds, one C(sp2) + C(sp2) s bond, and one \\nC(2p) + C(2p) p bond. The carbon–carbon s and p bonds are collectively referred \\nto as the carbon-carbon double bond. For the double bond, the bond order \\ndue to the s bond is 1 and that due to the p bond is 1, for a total bond order \\nof 2. A s bond and a p bond do not have the same energy, so a double bond, \\nalthough much stronger than a single bond, is not twice as strong as a single \\nbond. Carbon–carbon single-bond energies are about 0.6 aJ, whereas carbon–\\ncarbon double-bond energies are about 1 aJ. As Figure 9.34 shows, the overlap \\nof the two 2p orbitals that form the p orbital locks the molecule into a planar \\nconfiguration.\\n\\neXAMPLe 9-8: Describe the bonding in the methanal molecule, gener-\\nally referred to by its common name, formaldehyde, which has the Lewis \\nformula\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\nC O\\n\\nSolution: From VSEPR theory, we conclude that a formaldehyde molecule \\nhas a trigonal planar geometry around the carbon atom with bond angles \\nof about 120°.

COvALent BOnDIng294\\n\\nTo see the consequences of the lack of rotation about double bonds, \\nconsider the molecule 1,2-dichloroethene, ClCH=CHCl. (The 1,2 designa-\\ntion tells us that the chlorine atoms are attached to different carbon atoms; \\nsee Interchapters F and G). Because there is essentially no rotation about \\nthe carbon–carbon double bond, there are two distinct structural forms of  \\n1,2-dichloroethene:\\n\\ntrans isomer cis isomer\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\nC C\\n\\nH\\nC C\\n\\nCl\\n\\nHCl\\n\\nClCl\\n\\nThe first of these is called trans-1,2-dichloroethene because the chlorine \\natoms lie across the double bond from each other (trans means “across”). The \\nother is called cis-1,2-dichloroethene because the chlorine atoms lie on the \\nsame side of the double bond (cis means “on the same side”).\\n\\nAs we saw in the previous chapter, molecules with the same atom-to- \\natom bonding but different spatial arrangements are called stereoisomers. The  \\nparticular type of stereoisomerism that is displayed by 1,2-dichloroethene is \\ncalled cis-trans isomerism. Stereoisomers, and cis-trans isomers in particular, \\nhave different physical properties. Although both the trans  and cis  isomers of \\n1,2-dichloroethene have polar bonds, the trans  isomer has no net dipole mo-\\nment, but the cis  isomer does. The boiling point of the trans  isomer of 1,2-di-\\nchloroethene is 48°C and that of the cis  isomer is 60°C. We shall show in Chap-\\nter 15 why the cis  isomer, with its net dipole moment, has a higher boiling point \\nthan the nonpolar trans  isomer. \\n\\nAn example of the importance of cis-trans isomerism occurs in the chemis-\\ntry of vision.

The vision response occurs \\nthrough a sequence of processes that has been investigated quite thoroughly. The \\nprimary event, however, is the conversion of the cis to the trans isomer of retinal.\\n\\n9-12.  A triple Bond Can Be represented by One s Bond \\nand two p Bonds\\n\\nLet’s next consider a molecule that contains a triple bond. A good example is \\nan ethyne molecule, C2H2, which is generally referred to by its common name, \\nacetylene. The Lewis formula for an acetylene molecule is H C HC . An \\nacetylene molecule is linear, with each carbon atom bonded to only two other \\natoms. We saw in Section 9.5 that sp hybrid orbitals are appropriate to describe \\nthe bonding of an atom that forms two bonds separated by 180° (Figure 9.17).\\n\\nWe can build a s-bond framework for an acetylene molecule in two steps: \\nWe first form a carbon-carbon s-bond orbital by combining two sp orbitals, one \\nfrom each carbon atom. We then form the two carbon–hydrogen s-bond orbit-\\nals by combining a hydrogen 1s orbital with the sp orbital on each carbon atom. \\n\\nFigure 9.37 The s-bond framework of \\nan acetylene, HC≡CH, molecule.

These orbitals \\ncan combine to produce two p-bond orbitals. These two p-bond orbitals are oc-\\ncupied by the four remaining valence electrons to form two p bonds. The total \\nbond order for the carbon–carbon triple bond is 3, due to the two electrons in \\nthe s bond and the four electrons that occupy the two p bonds. The triple bond \\nconsists of one s bond and two p bonds (Figure 9.38b).\\n\\neXAMPLe 9-9: Compare the bonding in an acetylene molecule with that \\nin a hydrogen cyanide molecule, HCN.\\n\\nSolution: The Lewis formula for a HCN molecule is H C N  . Because \\nVSEPR theory predicts that the molecule is linear, it is appropriate to use \\nsp orbitals on both the carbon atom and the nitrogen atom in HCN. The \\ns-bond framework of a HCN molecule is shown in Figure 9.39; it is similar \\nto that of an C2H2 molecule (Figures 9.37 and 9.38). The 2p orbitals of the \\ncarbon and nitrogen atoms combine to form the two p-bond orbitals. There \\nare four bond orbitals in HCN: two are s-bond orbitals and two are p-bond \\norbitals.

Thus, it is appropriate to use sp2 \\nhybrid orbitals on the carbon atoms to describe the bonding in a benzene mol-\\necule. This depiction leads directly to the s-bond framework shown in Figure \\n9.40. Note that there are 12 s-bond orbitals.\\n\\nEach carbon atom also has a 2p orbital that is perpendicular to the hex-\\nagonal plane. These six 2p orbitals combine to give a total of six p molecular \\norbitals (conservation of orbitals). The six combinations of the six 2p orbitals \\nperpendicular to the benzene ring and the resulting corresponding molecular \\norbitals are shown in Figure 9.41.

In the orbital of lowest energy (Figure 9.41a), \\nall six 2p orbitals are aligned, which means that the resultant molecular orbital \\nconsists of a sum of all six 2p orbitals. Observe that the molecular orbital looks \\nlike one ring above the plane of the molecule and one below it. This molecular \\norbital is a bonding orbital. Because it is spread over several nuclei it is said to be \\ndelocalized, and the electrons that occupy this orbital are said to be delocalized \\nas well. The next set of orbitals (Figure 9.41b and c) is doubly degenerate: in \\nother words, the two molecular orbitals have the same energy. It turns out that \\none of the molecular orbitals actually consists of a combination of only four 2p\\norbitals. In both cases, however, the 2p orbitals are combined in such a way that \\nthere is one nodal plane in the molecular orbital that is perpendicular to the \\nplane of the molecule, as you can see in Figure 9.41. Although higher in energy \\nthan the first molecular orbital because of the nodal plane, these two doubly \\ndegenerate molecular orbitals are bonding orbitals. They are also delocalized \\nbecause one ranges over four nuclei and the other over six nuclei. The third set \\nof orbitals (Figure 9.41d and e) shows that the 2p orbitals are combined such \\nthat the resultant molecular orbital has two nodal planes that are perpendicu-\\nlar to the plane of the molecule. These doubly degenerate molecular orbitals \\nturn out to be antibonding orbitals. Finally, the molecular orbital of highest \\nenergy (Figure 9.41f) is formed by combining the six 2p orbitals in an alternat-\\n\\nFigure 9.41 The combination of the \\nsix 2p orbitals perpendicular to \\nthe hexagonal plane of the s-bond \\nframework of a benzene molecule. \\nEach picture illustrates how the positive \\nlobes and negative lobes of the 2p \\norbitals perpendicular to the planar \\ns-bond framework are oriented with \\nrespect to each other.

The resultant molecular orbital has three nodal planes that are \\nperpendicular to the plane of the molecule and is also an antibonding orbital.\\n\\nA benzene molecule serves as a nice illustration of the energy of a wave func-\\ntion and its number of nodes. A result from quantum theory says that the more \\nnodes that a wave function has, the greater its energy. We see from Figure 9.41 \\nthat the lowest-energy orbital of a benzene molecule has no nodes perpendicu-\\nlar to its plane; the next two (doubly degenerate) orbitals each have one such \\nnode; the next two (doubly degenerate) orbitals each have two such nodes; and \\nthe highest-energy orbital has three such nodes.\\n\\nA benzene molecule has (6 × 4) + (6 × 1) = 30 valence electrons. In its ground \\nelectronic state, 24 of these electrons occupy the 12 s-bond orbitals and the re-\\nmaining six occupy the three p orbitals of lowest energy in Figure 9.41. All six \\nof these p electrons are in delocalized molecular orbitals, which gives benzene \\nan extraordinary degree of stability. Delocalization in our quantum theoreti-\\ncal description is what resonance in the Lewis formula description attempts to \\nshow. The use of delocalized p molecular orbitals provides a more satisfying \\nand clearer picture than do the Lewis formula resonance forms.\\n\\nSuMMAry\\nIn Chapter 5 we discussed the atomic orbitals of the simplest atom, hydrogen, \\nand then used them to write electron configurations for other atoms. In this \\nchapter, we presented the molecular orbitals of the simplest diatomic species, \\nH2+, and then used them to discuss the bonding in other diatomic molecules. \\nThe bonding properties of diatomic molecules depend on the number of elec-\\ntrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals. Molecular orbital theory correctly \\npredicts that the diatomic molecules He2 and Ne2 do not exist under normal \\nconditions and that O2(g) is paramagnetic.\\n\\nIn our treatment of polyatomic molecules, we use localized bond orbitals. \\nOnce the geometry of a molecule is known, we can choose a hybrid orbital \\nto describe the localized bonding. Table 9.3 summarizes the associated geom-\\netries of various hybrid atomic orbitals.\\n\\nBond orbitals for single bonds are cylindrically symmetric about the bond \\naxis and are called s-bond orbitals. A s-bond orbital occupied by two electrons \\nof opposite spin constitutes a s bond.\\n\\nDouble bonds can be represented by one s bond and one p bond. The \\np bond is formed by the combination of p orbitals on adjacent atoms. The atoms \\nbonded directly to double-bonded atoms all lie in one plane. Because a mole-\\ncule in its ground state cannot rotate about a double bond, cis  and trans  isomers \\ncan result. Triple bonds can be represented by one s bond and two p bonds.\\n\\nIn some molecules, such as benzene, the p-bond orbitals are spread more or \\nless uniformly over many atoms and are said to be delocalized. Delocalization \\nof electrons confers an extra degree of stability on a molecule or ion, which ac-\\ncounts for the relative stability of benzene.\\n\\nIn describing molecules such as benzene, we use localized bonds to treat  \\ns bonds and molecular orbital theory for p bonds. We use this mixed approach \\nbecause of its close connection with Lewis formulas and because in a great \\nmany molecules, the s bonds are localized and the p bonds are delocalized. \\nAs we shall see later, this approach will be useful when studying chemical  \\nreactivity.\\n\\nSuMMAry 299\\n\\n\\n\\n9.

The segregated school system at that time \\nusually did not go beyond the 8th grade for African-Americans, but due to his parents’ efforts, Julian \\nwas able to continue his education through high school. He was then accepted by DePauw University in \\nIndiana as a probationary student, and in spite of the inadequacy of his early education, he graduated \\nPhi Beta Kappa and valedictorian in 1920. With the encouragement of one of his chemistry professors, \\nJulian went on to graduate school at Harvard University. After attaining his master’s degree, he was \\nunable to obtain a teaching assistantship in order to support himself for his doctorate degree because \\nof the racial prejudices of the time. Nevertheless, he received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to \\nstudy at the University of Vienna, where he received his Ph.D. in 1931. Although he enjoyed the liberal \\nsocial environment and the freedom from racial prejudices in Vienna, Julian returned to the United \\nStates to accept a position at Howard University, where he met his future wife, Anna Johnson, the first \\nAfrican-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in sociology. He became embroiled in university politics \\nat Howard and was forced to leave in 1932. His former professor offered him a position in organic \\nchemistry at DePauw University. There his eloquent synthesis of a steroid used to treat glaucoma \\nderived from an inexpensive extract of Calabar beans earned him an international reputation. He \\nlater joined the Glidden Company as director of research of the Soya Products Division, where he \\ncontinued his research on steroids and earned 109 patents. In 1953 he founded Julian Laboratories, a \\nchemical company that employed more African-American chemists than any other facility at the time \\nand made him one of the wealthiest black businessmen in America. In addition to almost 20 honorary \\ndegrees, Julian was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1973 in recognition of his scientific \\nachievements. His life was the subject of a NOVA program entitled A Forgotten Genius, which appeared \\non PBS.\\n\\n\\n\\n307\\n\\n10. Chemical Reactivity\\n\\nHaving laid the foundations, we are finally able to begin what is at the heart of chemistry, the study of chemical reactions. In the first few chapters, we \\nlearned about chemical elements and saw how the elements can be classified \\nbased on reactivity into a periodic arrangement, known as the periodic table \\nof the elements. We then learned about modern quantum theory and how the \\nelectrons are arranged about the nucleus of an atom. We used these concepts \\nto understand chemical bonding and why certain chemical elements bond to-\\ngether to form molecules.\\n\\nNow in this chapter, based on our understanding of atoms, molecules, ions, \\nand bonding, we shall begin to learn how chemicals react with one another. In \\nthe following chapters, we shall learn how to carry out chemical calculations \\nand how chemists can predict the amount of products formed from a chemical \\nreaction. But first we must learn a little more about chemical reactions and how \\nchemists classify the various types of reactions.\\n\\nOne convenient classification scheme for chemical reactions has four  \\ncategories: (1) combination reactions, (2) decomposition reactions, (3) single- \\nreplacement reactions, and (4) double-replacement reactions. Although not all \\nchemical reactions fall into these four categories, many do, and it is helpful \\nwhen first learning about chemical reactions to try to classify them into these \\ntypes. Discussion of reaction types leads naturally to chemical nomenclature, \\nto relative activities of metals, and to an introduction to the chemistry of acids \\nand bases.\\n\\nFinally, we present another classification system for chemical reactions. All \\nchemical reactions can also be assigned to one of two classes: reactions in which \\nelectrons are transferred from one chemical species to another and reactions \\nin which electrons are not transferred. Reactions in which electrons are trans-\\nferred from one species to another are called oxidation-reduction (“redox”) \\nreactions or electron-transfer reactions.\\n\\nHere we present only a qualitative introduction to these various reaction \\nclasses. Many important reaction types, such as acid-base reactions, precipita-\\ntion reactions, and oxidation-reduction reactions, are further developed on a \\nquantitative basis in later chapters.\\n\\n10-1 Combination Reactions\\n\\n10-2 Nomenclature of Polyatomic Ions\\n\\n10-3 Acids and Bases\\n\\n10-4 Decomposition Reactions\\n\\n10-5 Hydrates\\n\\n10-6 Single-Replacement Reactions\\n\\n10-7 Relative Activities of Metals\\n\\n10-8 Relative Activities of Halogens\\n\\n10-9 Double-Replacement Reactions\\n\\n10-10 Acid-Base Reactions\\n\\n10-11 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions\\n\\n\\n\\n10. ChemiCal ReaCtivity308\\n\\n10-1.  a Combination Reaction is the Reaction of  \\ntwo Substances to Form a Single Product\\n\\nOne of the simplest classes of reactions is a combination reaction. In a combi-\\nnation reaction the reactants combine to form a single product. This type of \\nreaction occurs between either two elements, an element and a compound, or \\ntwo compounds. A combination reaction is easily recognized because it involves \\ntwo (or occasionally three) reactants and only a single product.\\n\\nAluminum is resistant to extensive air oxidation because the initial oxida-\\ntion of the aluminum metal by oxygen in air produces a tough, tightly adherent \\nlayer of aluminum oxide that is impervious to oxygen. This layer protects the un-\\nderlying metal from further oxidation. In contrast, iron is oxidized (corroded) \\nextensively by oxygen in air because the product iron(III) oxide is nonadher-\\nent. Thus, iron can be corroded completely by air oxidation. The oxidation of \\naluminum and iron by oxygen are examples of combination reactions involving \\na metal and a nonmetal, as described by the following chemical equations:\\n\\n4 Al(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Al2O3(s)\\n4 Fe(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Fe2O3(s)\\n\\nWhen the reactants in a combination reaction are a metal and a nonmetal, \\nthe product is often an ionic compound. Because ionic compounds almost al-\\nways have high melting points [for example, NaCl(s) melts at 800˚C and CaO(s) \\nmelts at 2850˚C], we shall assume that the ionic reaction products are formed \\nas solids, unless the reaction temperature is very high or a solvent in which the \\nionic compound is soluble is present. As we saw in Chapter 6, the high melting \\npoints of ionic compounds are a consequence of the strong electrostatic forces \\nbetween oppositely charged ions in the solid.\\n\\nMany combination reactions occur between two nonmetals. When two non-\\nmetals react, the product is a covalently bonded compound. For example, car-\\nbon burns in oxygen to give carbon dioxide, as described by the equation\\n\\n C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) (10.1)\\n\\nSulfur burns in oxygen with a blue flame (Figure 10.1) to form sulfur dioxide, \\nwhich is a toxic, colorless gas with a sharp, irritating odor.\\n\\n S(s) + O2(g) → SO2(g) (10.2)\\n\\nCarbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide are covalently bonded molecules. Covalent \\ncompounds are generally much more volatile than ionic compounds; that is, \\nthey are more readily vaporized than ionic solids and consequently tend to have \\nlower melting points and boiling points. Thus, the covalent compounds CO2(g) \\nand SO2(g) are gases at 25˚C, whereas, as noted, the ionic compounds NaCl(s) \\nand CaO(s) are solids even at high temperatures.\\n\\nThe reactions described in Equations 10.1 and 10.2 are also examples of \\ncombustion reactions (Figure 10.2). A combustion reaction is one in which a \\nsubstance (or fuel) is burned in oxygen or some other oxidizer (we shall discuss \\noxidation reactions in Section 10-11).\\n\\nThe combination reactions presented so far are combinations of two ele-\\n\\nFigure 10.1 Sulfur burns in oxygen with \\na blue flame. The production of sulfur \\ndioxide, SO2(g), by burning sulfur is \\na key reaction in the manufacture of \\nsulfuric acid. Sulfur dioxide is also \\nproduced when sulfur-containing coal \\nor petroleum is burned.\\n\\nFigure 10.2 Although steel wool does \\nnot burn in air, it burns vigorously in \\npure oxygen.\\n\\n\\n\\n10-2. PolyatomiC ionS Remain intaCt in aqueouS Solution 309\\n\\nments. We can also have combination reactions between compounds. Our first \\nexample is the reaction between sodium oxide Na2O(s) and carbon dioxide to \\nform the ionic compound sodium carbonate Na2CO3(s), which we represent as\\n\\nNa2O(s) + CO2(g) → Na2CO3(s)\\nsodium carbonate\\n\\nThis combination reaction can be used to remove carbon dioxide from air and \\nto measure the amount of carbon dioxide present in a gaseous sample by weigh-\\ning the solid before and after addition of the gaseous sample.\\n\\nWhen the gases ammonia and hydrogen chloride are mixed (Figure 10.3), \\nthey combine to form the ionic compound ammonium chloride as described \\nby the equation\\n\\nNH3(g) + HCl(g) → NH4Cl(s)\\nammonium chloride\\n\\nAnother example of a combination reaction involving two compounds is the \\nreaction of sulfur trioxide, SO3(g), with magnesium oxide, MgO(s), to form the \\nionic compound magnesium sulfate, MgSO4(s), according to\\n\\nSO3(g) + MgO(s) → MgSO4(s)\\nmagnesium sulfate\\n\\nThis combination reaction can be used to remove sulfur trioxide from air.\\n\\n10-2. Polyatomic ions Remain intact in aqueous Solution\\n\\nWhen a covalent compound, such as ethanol, CH3CH2OH(l), is dissolved in \\nwater to form a solution, the ethanol and water molecules become more or less \\nevenly distributed throughout the solution (Figure 10.4). In contrast, when an \\nionic compound, such as sodium chloride, NaCl(s), dissolves in water, the spe-\\ncies dissociates into positive and negative ions that tend to be surrounded by \\nshells of water molecules in the solution (Figure 10.5). It turns out that these \\nshells of solvated ions have a lower energy than the ions in the crystal lattice, \\nthus accounting for the solubility of sodium chloride in water.\\n\\nWe can represent the process of dissolution of an ionic solid by a chemical \\nequation, such as\\n\\n \\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ Na+(aq) + Cl–(aq)NaCl(s) H2O(l )  \\n\\n(10.3)\\n\\nThe placement of H2O(l) below the reaction arrow indicates that water is act-\\ning as a solvent for the products; that is, water is the liquid in which the so-\\ndium chloride dissolves. The symbols Na+(aq) and Cl–(aq) indicate that sodium \\nchloride forms ions in aqueous solution. It is perfectly acceptable to write the \\nformula NaCl(aq) to indicate that sodium chloride has been dissolved in water, \\nbut the dissolution equation given above shows a clearer picture of what is actu-\\nally occurring in the solution. As we shall see in the upcoming sections, many \\nimportant chemical reactions occur between the various ions present in aque-\\nous solutions.\\n\\nFigure 10.3 Ammonia and hydrogen \\nchloride are colorless gases. They react \\nin a combination reaction to produce \\nthe solid white compound ammonium \\nchloride NH4Cl(s).

Let’s now consider ammo-\\nnium chloride, NH4Cl(s). Solid ammonium chloride is highly soluble in water. \\nOn the basis of the dissolution reaction of sodium chloride (Equation 10.3), \\nyou might predict (incorrectly) that when ammonium chloride is dissolved in wa-\\nter it breaks up into ions of its component elements according to the equation\\n\\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ N3–(aq) + 4H+(aq) + Cl–(aq)   (incorrect)   NH4Cl H2O(l )\\n\\nbut this is not the case. It turns out that when NH4Cl(s) is dissolved in water, \\nessentially only two ions per formula unit are produced:\\n\\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ NH+4(aq) + Cl\\n–(aq)   NH4Cl(s) H2O(l )ammonium\\n\\nchloride\\nammonium\\n\\nion\\nchloride\\n\\nion\\n\\nWhat we call an ammonium ion, NH4+, tends to remain intact as a polyatomic \\nion in aqueous solution.

When magnesium sulfate, MgSO4(s), is \\ndissolved in water, only two ions per MgSO4 formula unit are produced as de-\\nscribed by\\n\\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ Mg2+(aq) + SO4\\n2–(aq)   MgSO4(s) H2O(l)\\n\\nmagnesium\\nsulfate\\n\\nmagnesium\\nion\\n\\nsulfate\\nion\\n\\nThe SO42– ion remains intact as a polyatomic ion in aqueous solution (Figure \\n10.6).\\n\\nFigure 10.5 When an ionic compound \\nsuch as sodium chloride, NaCl(s), is \\ndissolved in water, the water molecules \\ntend to form shells that solvate the \\nresultant ions.

PolyatomiC ionS Remain intaCt in aqueouS Solution 311\\n\\nAs we have already noted, polyatomic ions like NH4+ and SO42– are charged \\nspecies held together by covalent bonds. We can illustrate this fact by using the \\nrules we learned in Chapter 7 to write the Lewis formulas of these ions. The \\nLewis formula for an NH4+ ion is\\n\\nH N\\n+\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nand that for a SO42– ion is\\n\\nO S\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\nother resonance\\nstructures\\n\\n– –\\n\\nThe polyatomic ion SO42– is called a sulfate ion; similarly, the name of MgSO4(s) \\nis magnesium sulfate.\\n\\nThere are many polyatomic ions that are important in chemistry. Table 10.1 \\nlists some of the most common of these. The table is grouped by charge and \\narranged so that compounds with similar chemical formulas and names are \\ngrouped together. Many of the polyatomic ions have irregular names, generally \\nbecause they were named prior to our modern systematic nomenclature. How-\\never, in the case of the oxyanions, anions involving nonmetals combined with \\noxygen, we can often apply the following systematic rules:\\n\\n 1.   If a nonmetal forms two possible anions with oxygen, the one with the \\nfewer number of oxygen atoms has the suffix -ite, and the greater number \\nof oxygen atoms has the suffix -ate  attached to the root of the nonmetal’s \\nname. For example,\\n\\nNO2– is nitrite\\nNO3– is nitrate\\n\\nMg2+\\n\\nSO42\\n– \\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n07/21/09\\n\\n010-005.6\\n\\nFigure 10.6 MgSO4(s) dissolves \\nin water to form Mg2+(aq) and \\nSO42–(aq) ions.\\n\\n\\n\\n10. ChemiCal ReaCtivity312\\n\\n2.   If the nonmetal forms three possible anions with oxygen, the prefix hypo- \\nand the suffix -ite  are attached to the root of the nonmetal’s name with the \\nfewest number of oxygen atoms. We then follow Rule 1 for the remaining \\ntwo. If the nonmetal can form four possible anions with oxygen, then in \\naddition the prefix per-  and the suffix -ate  are attached to the ion with the \\ngreatest number of oxygen atoms. An example of this is the naming of the \\noxychloro anions (so called because they contain chlorine and differing \\nnumbers of oxygen atoms) given in Table 10.2.\\n\\n3.   Oxyanions that contain a hydrogen atom are named by placing the word \\nhydrogen before the name of the oxyanion. For example, HPO42– is called \\na hydrogen phosphate ion. When an oxyanion contains more than one \\nhydrogen atom, the number of hydrogen atoms is designated by a Greek \\nprefix, (di-, tri-, and so on, see Table 2.7). For example, H2PO4– is called a \\ndihydrogen phosphate ion. (An older system of nomenclature places the \\nprefix bi- before the name of oxyanions that contain a single hydrogen \\natom.

Some metal oxides yield bases and Some hydrogen-\\nContaining Compounds yield acids When Combined  \\nwith Water\\n\\nAn important class of combination reactions are those that involve the com-\\nbination of metal oxides or of nonmetal oxides with water. For example, if we \\ncombine solid sodium oxide with an excess of water, then the water acts both as \\na reactant and as a solvent for the products according to\\n\\n→ 2 NaOH(aq)   Na2O(s) + H2O(l)\\nsodium hydroxide\\n\\n(10.4)\\n\\nSimilarly, barium oxide reacts with an excess of water according to\\n\\n→ Ba(OH)2(aq)   BaO(s) + H2O(l) (10.5)\\nbarium hydroxide\\n\\nIn aqueous solution NaOH(aq) exists as the ions Na+(aq) and OH–(aq), \\nand Ba(OH)2(aq) exists as the ions Ba2+(aq) and OH–(aq). Thus, the above two \\nequations often are written in the more explicit form\\n\\n\\n\\n→ 2 Na+(aq) + 2 OH–(aq)   Na2O(s) + H2O(l )\\n\\nand\\n\\n→ Ba2+(aq) + 2 OH–(aq)   BaO(s) + H2O(l )\\n\\nA compound that yields hydroxide ions (OH–) when dissolved in water is called \\na base. Both sodium hydroxide and barium hydroxide are bases.\\n\\nMany metal oxides do not react with water and so do not form basic so-\\nlutions. An example of such a nonreactive metal oxide is aluminum oxide, \\nAl2O3(s). This compound gives the surface of aluminum doors and window \\nframes their dull appearance and is inert (unreactive) in water. Thus, we write\\n\\nAl2O3(s) + H2O(l) → no reaction\\n\\nThe only metal oxides that react with water are the Group 1 metal oxides and \\nsome of the Group 2 metal oxides (Figure 10.8).\\n\\neXamPle 10-4: Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction of \\npotassium oxide, K2O(s), with water.\\n\\nSolution: Potassium is a Group 1 metal, so its oxide reacts with water much \\nas sodium oxide does. Using Equation 10.4 for the reaction of Na2O(s) with \\nwater as a guide, we write\\n\\n→ 2 K+(aq) + 2 OH–(aq)   K2O(s) + H2O(l )\\n\\nBecause hydroxide ions are produced when K2O(s) reacts with water, \\nKOH(aq) is a base.\\n\\nPRaCtiCe PRoblem 10-4: Which one of the following metal oxides \\ncan react with water to form a basic solution?\\n(a) Fe2O3(s) (b) ZnO(s) (c) SrO(s) (d) TiO2(s)\\nWrite a balanced chemical equation for the reaction that occurs.\\n\\nAnswer: SrO(s) is the only metal oxide containing a Group 1 or Group 2 \\nmetal.\\n\\n→ Sr2+(aq) + 2 OH–(aq)   SrO(s) + H2O(l)\\n\\nMany nonmetal oxides yield acids when combined with water. A simple \\ndefinition of an acid is a compound that yields hydrogen ions, H+(aq), when \\ndissolved in water. Experimental evidence suggests that H+(aq) ions in aque-\\nous solution exist in several forms, such as H3O+(aq), H5O2+(aq), and H9O4+(aq). \\nHowever, the species H3O+(aq), called the hydronium ion, is the dominant \\nspecies. Using Lewis formulas, we can write the equation for the formation of \\nH3O+(aq) as\\n\\n10-3. aCidS and baSeS 315\\n\\nFigure 10.8 Metals whose oxides react \\nwith water, forming basic solutions.\\n\\nLi\\n\\nNa\\n\\nK Ca\\n\\nRb Sr\\n\\nCs Ba\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n06/11/09\\n\\n010-007\\n\\n\\n\\n10.

For simplicity, we sometimes denote a hydrogen ion in water by \\nH+(aq) instead of H3O+(aq).\\n\\nIt is not possible, in most cases, to decide whether a compound is an acid \\nsimply from the presence of hydrogen atoms in its chemical formula. The fact \\nthat a compound contains hydrogen atoms does not guarantee that it will yield \\nH+(aq) ions in water. For example, hydrogen, H2(g), methane, CH4(g), and eth-\\nanol, CH3CH2OH(l), are not acids. We shall learn the criteria for determining \\nif a compound is an acid in Chapter 20; at this point we shall only introduce \\nsome of the more common acids and their reactions.\\n\\nSome common polyatomic acids and their corresponding anions are given \\nin Table 10.3. Notice that in each of these cases an acid is formed when a hydro-\\ngen cation is combined with a polyatomic anion from Table 10.1. Also note that \\nin the case of acetic acid only the hydrogen atom in the –COOH group is acidic; \\nthe three hydrogen atoms in the –CH3 group are not acidic. The equation that \\ndescribes the acidic nature of acetic acid is\\n\\nH+(aq)  +(aq)CH3 C\\nH\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\nCH3 C\\n\\nO\\n\\nO –\\n\\nThe hydrogen atoms in the chemical formula of acids that yield H+(aq) ions \\nwhen the acid is dissolved in water are called acidic hydrogen atoms or acidic \\nprotons. Recall from Chapter 2 that a neutral hydrogen atom contains one \\nproton and one electron, so that a H+(aq) ion is simply a proton. Nitric acid, \\nHNO3(aq), is said to be a monoprotic acid because it has one acidic proton; \\nsulfuric acid, H2SO4(aq), is said to be a diprotic acid because it has two acidic \\nprotons.\\n\\nH2SO4(aq) → 2 H+(aq) + SO42–(aq)\\n\\nPhosphoric acid, H3PO4(aq) is said to be a triprotic acid because it has three \\nacidic protons. Acids that have more than one acidic proton are also referred to \\ncollectively as polyprotic acids.\\n\\neXamPle 10-5: Write a chemical equation showing the dissolution of \\nnitric acid into ions in water.\\n\\nSolution: According to Table 10.3, the chemical formula of nitric acid is \\nHNO3 and the formula of its corresponding anion is NO3–. Consequently, \\nwe write\\n\\nHNO3(aq) → H+(aq) + NO3–(aq)\\n\\n(aq)\\n\\n\\n\\nPRaCtiCe PRoblem 10-5: Oxalic acid, which is formed from the \\noxalate polyatomic anion (Table 10.1), can be extracted from the roots and \\nleaves of plants such as rhubarb and tea. Predict whether oxalic acid is a \\nmonoprotic, diprotic, or triprotic acid. \\n\\nAnswer: diprotic\\n\\nThe acids listed in Table 10.3 are called oxyacids because their chemical \\nformulas contain oxygen atoms. The nomenclature of the oxyacids is also based \\non the name of the anion from which the acid is derived and can be summa-\\nrized by the following two rules:\\n\\n 1.   If the name of the anion ends in -ite, then the corresponding acid name \\nends in -ous acid.\\n\\n 2.   If the name of the anion ends in -ate, then the corresponding acid name \\nends in -ic acid.\\n\\nThe following Example illustrates the application of these rules.\\n\\n \\neXamPle 10-6: Name the following oxyacids:\\n(a) HNO2(aq) (b) H2C2O4(aq) (c) HClO4(aq)\\n\\nSolution: (a) HNO2(aq) is formed from a proton and a nitrite anion.

The most important binary acid is \\nhydrochloric acid, HCl(aq), which is obtained by dissolving hydrogen chloride \\ngas in water:\\n\\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ H+(aq) + Cl–(aq)   HCl(g) H2O(l)\\nhydrochloric acid\\n\\nThe formulas and names of four common binary acids are given in Table 10.5. \\nWhen naming binary acids, we simply add the prefix hydro- to the name of the \\nanion and the suffix -ic  plus the word acid. For example, the binary acid H2S(aq) \\nis named hydrosulfuric acid. Note that an acidic substance must be dissolved in \\na solution to be an acid. For example, HCl(g) is hydrogen chloride, whereas \\nHCl(aq) is hydrochloric acid.\\n\\nIn addition to the polyatomic acids (Table 10.3) and binary acids (Table \\n10.5), soluble organic substances with a Lewis formula that contains the func-\\ntional group –COOH are also acidic. Such substances are called organic acids \\n(Interchapter R).

The chemical formula of acetic acid is often written as CH3COOH(aq), \\nrather than as HC2H3O2(aq), to emphasize the presence of the –COOH group \\n(Table 10.3). This is actually the preferable way to write it.\\n\\nWe should point out that formic acid and acetic acid are actually the older \\nor common names of what are now systematically named methanoic acid and \\nethanoic acid, respectively. However, because the common names of these sub-\\nstances are still the ones preferred in general usage, we use the older names \\nhere. (We discuss the systematic naming of carboxylic acids in Interchapter R.)\\n\\nWe can use the Lewis formulas that we developed in Chapter 7 to under-\\nstand the acidity of carboxylic acids. Let’s look, for example, at acetic acid. When \\nacetic acid dissociates into ions, the acetate anion formed may be described by \\nthe two resonance formulas\\n\\nCC\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\n–\\n\\nC C\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\n–\\n\\nor by the resonance hybrid\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n–\\n\\nC C\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nThe Lewis formula of the hybrid shows that the negative charge is distrib-\\nuted equally between the two oxygen atoms. This delocalization of the nega-\\ntive charge over the two oxygen atoms confers an added degree of stability to \\nthe acetate anion. Recall from Chapters 7 and 9 that resonance structures are \\nparticularly stable. Therefore, we can explain the acidity of organic acids (ac-\\nids containing a –COOH group) by the fact that these acids leave behind a  \\nresonance-stabilized anion when they dissociate in solution.\\n\\nBecause acids and bases are so important in chemistry, we have listed a few \\nof their properties in Table 10.6. (We shall discuss acids and bases in greater \\ndepth in Chapters 20 and 21.) As the table shows, an acidic solution tastes sour. \\nVinegar tastes sour because it is a dilute solution of acetic acid; lemon juice \\ntastes sour because it contains citric acid; and rhubarb tastes sour because it \\n\\n10-3. aCidS and baSeS 319\\n\\n Acid Formula Anion Corresponding gas\\n\\n hydrobromic acid HBr(aq) Br–(aq) hydrogen bromide, HBr(g)\\n\\n hydrochloric acid HCl(aq) Cl–(aq) hydrogen chloride, HCl(g)\\n\\n hydroiodic acid HI(aq) I–(aq) hydrogen iodide, HI(g)\\n\\n hydrosulfuric acid H2S(aq) S2–(aq) hydrogen sulfide, H2S(g)\\n\\ntable 10.5 Common binary acids\\n\\n\\n\\n10.

An interesting and important property of \\nacidic and basic solutions is their effect on certain dyes and vegetable matter. \\nLitmus, which is a vegetable substance obtained from lichens, is red in acidic \\nsolutions and blue in basic solutions. Paper impregnated with litmus, called \\nlitmus paper, provides us with the means to perform a quick test to see whether \\na solution is acidic or basic (Figure 10.9). Because many acids and bases are \\npoisonous, we never  test for acidity or basicity by tasting chemicals.\\n\\n10-4.  in a decomposition Reaction, a Substance is broken down \\ninto two or more less Complex Substances\\n\\nA decomposition reaction is the opposite of a combination reaction because de-\\ncomposition involves the breaking apart of a substance into simpler substances. \\nSuch a reaction is easy to recognize because there is only one reactant and more \\nthan one product. For example, when heated, many metal oxides decompose \\nby giving off oxygen gas. When mercury(II) oxide is heated (Figure 10.10), it \\ndecomposes into its constituent elements, mercury and oxygen according to\\n\\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ 2 Hg(g) + O2(g)   2 HgO(s)\\nhigh T\\n\\nThe designation “high T ” (T for temperature) over the arrow indicates that \\nthe reaction must be run at a high temperature.

Such water-containing compounds are called hydrates. For example, when \\nwhite copper sulfate crystals are combined with water, the reaction produces a \\nbright blue solid. The chemical equation describing this reaction is\\n\\nCuSO4(s) + 5 H2O(l) → CuSO4·5 H2O(s)\\ncopper sulfate                         copper sulfate pentahydrate \\n\\n(white)                                           (bright blue)\\n\\nThe bright blue crystals that form are a hydrate of copper sulfate known as cop-\\nper sulfate pentahydrate. Unlike ionic and covalent bonds, the water molecules \\nin a hydrate (the waters of hydration) are loosely bound to the salt and can gen-\\nerally be driven off by gentle heating.

(b) Although hydrogen gas is not a metal, \\nit is generally included in the activity series of metals because it can be \\ndisplaced from acids (or sometimes even water) by an active metal.

(b) Hydrogen should be placed between cop-\\nper and lead.

However, the relative activities of the halogens can \\nbe readily established by means of single-replacement reactions. For example, \\nif bromine is added to an aqueous solution of sodium iodide, free iodine is \\nproduced according to\\n\\nBr2(l) + 2 NaI(aq) → 2 NaBr(aq) + I2(s)\\n\\nThis result implies that bromine is more active than iodine. The iodine pro-\\nduced appears as a solid because I2(s) is only slightly soluble in water.\\n\\nSimilarly, if chlorine gas is bubbled into an aqueous solution of sodium bro-\\nmide, as shown in Figure 10.19, then free bromine is produced:\\n\\nCl2(g) + 2 NaBr(aq) → 2 NaCl(aq) + Br2(aq)\\n\\nThis result implies that chlorine is more active than bromine. Finally, fluorine \\nnot only is the most active halogen but also is the most active element. Fluorine \\nreadily displaces chlorine from chlorides; for example,\\n\\nF2(g) + 2 KCl(s) → 2 KF(s) + Cl2(g)\\n\\nThus, the halogens may be ranked in order of activity as\\n\\nF2 > Cl2 > Br2 > I2\\n\\nGenerally, the activities of nonmetals (except for the noble gases) increase \\nas we go up within a group in the periodic table.

Both solutions are clear; yet when they are mixed, \\na white precipitate forms immediately (Figure 10.21). A precipitate is an in-\\nsoluble product of a reaction that occurs in solution. The chemical reaction \\nbetween sodium chloride and silver nitrate can be described by the equation\\n\\nNaCl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) → NaNO3(aq) + AgCl(s)\\n\\nThe white precipitate that forms is silver chloride, AgCl(s), an insoluble com-\\npound. The reaction is called a double-replacement reaction because we visual-\\nize it as an exchange of anions between the two cations, Na+(aq) and Ag+(aq).\\n\\nA double-replacement reaction involving the formation of a precipitate is \\ncalled a precipitation reaction. It is instructive to analyze the above equation \\nfor the silver chloride precipitation reaction in terms of the ions involved. So-\\ndium chloride and silver nitrate are both soluble ionic compounds. Therefore, \\nan aqueous solution of sodium chloride consists of Na+(aq) and Cl–(aq) ions. \\nSimilarly, an aqueous solution of silver nitrate consists of Ag+(aq) and NO3–(aq) \\nions. At the very instant the sodium chloride and silver nitrate solutions are \\nmixed, these four kinds of ions exist in one solution. As we show in later chap-\\nters, the ions in a solution constantly move around and collide with water mol-\\necules and with one another. If a Na+(aq) ion collides with a Cl–(aq) ion, they \\nsimply drift apart because sodium chloride is soluble in water. Similarly, a col-\\nlision between a Ag+(aq) ion and a NO3–(aq) ion is of no consequence because \\nsilver nitrate is also soluble in water. However, when a Ag+(aq) ion collides with \\na Cl–(aq) ion, silver chloride is formed. Because silver chloride is insoluble in \\nwater, it precipitates out of solution as AgCl(s). We say that the driving force \\nof the chemical reaction between sodium chloride and silver nitrate is the for-\\nmation of the silver chloride precipitate. In other words, the formation of an \\ninsoluble precipitate drives a precipitation reaction toward the product side of \\nthe reaction.\\n\\nIn order to appreciate precipitation reactions, we must have some idea of \\nwhich compounds are soluble and which are insoluble. While it is not possible \\nto predict the solubility of all compounds, it is possible to state a few rules of \\nthumb that can be used to predict whether a compound is likely to be soluble or \\ninsoluble in water (Table 10.9).\\n\\nFigure 10.20 Activity trends of metals \\nand nonmetals.\\n\\nFigure 10.21 The reaction of sodium \\nchloride, NaCl(aq), with silver \\nnitrate, AgNO3(aq), yields the white \\nprecipitate, silver chloride, AgCl(s).\\n\\nIncreasing\\nactivity of metals\\n\\nIncreasing activity\\nof nonmetals Noble gasesnonreactive\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n09/10/09\\n\\n010-020\\n\\nx\\n\\n\\n\\ntable 10.9 Solubility Rules (applied in the order given)\\n\\n 1.

In other words, because calcium \\nacetate and sodium bromide will produce the same ions  in solution that the \\nreactants sodium acetate and calcium bromide produce, no net chemical \\nchange occurs.

Bases like sodium hydroxide are also very \\ncorrosive, causing painful burns and blisters on the skin, just as hydrochloric \\nacid does. Thus, the reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide \\nis one between two reactive and hazardous substances, but the products are \\nsodium chloride and water, a harmless aqueous solution of table salt. We say \\nthat the acid and the base have neutralized each other. The chemical reaction \\nbetween an acid and a base is called a neutralization reaction. The ionic com-\\npound that is formed along with the water in a neutralization reaction is called \\na salt. For example,\\n\\nH2SO4(aq) + 2 KOH(aq) → K2SO4(aq) + 2 H2O(l)\\nacid                  base                      salt                  water\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this case the salt that is formed, potassium sulfate, K2SO4(aq), is water-\\nsoluble and exists in solution primarily in the form of its constituent ions, \\n2 K+(aq) and SO42–(aq).\\n\\nThe essential chemical characteristic of an acid is its production of H+(aq) \\nions in aqueous solutions, and the essential chemical characteristic of a base \\nis its production of OH–(aq) ions in aqueous solutions (Table 10.6). When an \\nacid and a base neutralize each other, the H+(aq) ions and OH–(aq) ions react \\nto produce H2O(l); and in so doing they nullify the acidic and basic character \\nof the separate solutions:\\n\\nH+(aq) + OH–(aq) → H2O(l)\\nacid            base                water\\n\\n \\neXamPle 10-16: Complete and balance the equation for the following \\nneutralization reaction and name the salt formed.

ChemiCal ReaCtivity334\\n\\nWe have shown that double-replacement reactions are driven by the forma-\\ntion of a precipitate or the formation of a neutral covalent compound, such \\nas water, from ions in the solution. A third type of driving force for a double- \\nreplacement reaction is a variation of the latter type, namely, the formation of \\na gaseous covalent product.\\n\\nAn example is provided by the reaction of calcium carbonate (limestone), \\nCaCO3(s), with a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid as described by the chemi-\\ncal equation\\n\\nCaCO3(s) + 2 HCl(aq) → CaCl2(aq) + H2CO3(aq)\\n\\nThe corresponding net ionic equation is\\n\\nCaCO3(s) + 2 H+(aq) → Ca2+(aq) + H2CO3(aq)\\n\\nThe carbonic acid, H2CO3(aq), formed in this double-replacement reaction is \\nunstable and decomposes to form carbon dioxide and water:\\n\\nH2CO3(aq) → H2O(l) + CO2(g)\\n\\nThus, the overall reaction equation may be written as\\n\\nCaCO3(s) + 2 HCl(aq) → CaCl2(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)\\n\\nwhere it is understood that this is a double-replacement reaction because the \\nwater and carbon dioxide gas come from the subsequent decomposition of car-\\nbonic acid.\\n\\nThe carbon dioxide gas formed is not very soluble in water and so escapes \\nfrom the solution. The evolution of carbon dioxide gas from the reaction mix-\\nture drives the reaction toward the product side. The evolution of an odorless \\ngas by limestone when treated with dilute acids is used as a simple geological \\nfield test for this mineral (Figure 10.23).\\n\\n \\neXamPle 10-17: Treatment of zinc sulfide with a dilute aqueous hydro-\\nchloric acid solution yields a toxic gas that smells like rotten eggs.

Reactions in which electrons are transferred from \\none species to another are called oxidation-reduction (“redox”) reactions or \\nelectron-transfer reactions. The simplest example of an oxidation-reduction \\nreaction is the reaction between a metal and a nonmetal. For example, the reac-\\ntion of sodium metal with sulfur produces the ionic compound sodium sulfide \\n(Figure 10.25), as described by the equation\\n\\n2 Na(s) + S(s) → Na2S(s)\\n\\nWe can depict this equation in terms of Lewis electron-dot formulas by  \\nwriting\\n\\n2 Na+\\n2–\\n\\nS+ +2 Na S\\n\\n[Ne][Ne]3s23p4[Ne]3s1 [Ne]3s23p6\\n\\nor [Ar]\\n\\nThe ionic products in this equation both have noble-gas electron configura-\\ntions. The stability of these ions accounts for the driving force of this reaction; \\nwe go from relatively reactive reactants to relatively stable products.\\n\\nWe see here that two sodium atoms react with one sulfur atom. The two \\nsodium atoms give up two electrons and the sulfur atom acquires the two elec-\\ntrons.\\n\\nAs this reaction shows, the electron transfer between species in a chemical \\nequation must be balanced; that is, in any oxidation-reduction reaction the total \\nnumber of electrons lost always equals the total number of electrons gained.\\n\\nWhen an atom in a reaction gives up electrons to another species, we say \\nthe atom is oxidized. The term oxidation denotes a loss of electrons. When an \\natom in a reaction accepts electrons from another species, we say the atom is \\nreduced. The term reduction denotes a gain of electrons.\\n\\nIt turns out that many of the reactions we have already studied are also \\noxidation-reduction reactions. For example, the combination reaction between \\niron metal and oxygen gas described by the equation\\n\\n 4 Fe(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Fe2O3(s)  (10.7)\\n\\nis also an oxidation-reduction reaction.

ChemiCal ReaCtivity336\\n\\noxygen gas has no ionic charge. As we saw in Chapter 6, the addition of two \\nelectrons to a neutral oxygen atom gives it a noble-gas electron configuration, \\nso oxygen atoms often have a –2 ionic charge in ionic compounds. Taking the \\nionic charge of each oxygen atom in Fe2O3(s) as –2, we see that in order to main-\\ntain electronic neutrality, the ionic charge of each iron atom in the compound \\nmust be +3, because 2(+3) + 3(–2) = 0. \\n\\n(0)  (0)  (+3) (–2)\\n\\n4 Fe(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Fe2O3(s) \\n\\nBecause the ionic charge of each of the four iron atoms in Equation 10.7 changes \\nfrom 0 to +3, we say that the iron atoms are oxidized in the reaction. Similarly, \\nbecause the ionic charge of each of the six oxygen atoms changes from 0 to –2, \\nwe say that the oxygen atoms are reduced in the reaction. Therefore, we see that \\nthis reaction is an oxidation-reduction reaction. Notice also that the total num-\\nber of electrons lost by the iron atoms in this reaction is equal to the total num-\\nber of electrons gained by the oxygen atoms. That is, four iron atoms go from \\nan ionic charge of 0 to +3 for a total loss of 4 × 3 = 12 electrons and six oxygen \\natoms go from an ionic charge of 0 to –2 for a total gain of 6 × 2 = 12 electrons.\\n\\nWe show the changes in ionic charges in the chemical equation. Recall that \\nFe2O3(s) is named iron(III) oxide, where the Roman numeral three indicates \\nthe ionic charge of each iron atom in the compound. Iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3(s), \\nand its hydrates are the principal components of rust. In fact, the formation of \\nrust is often referred to as the oxidation of iron.\\n\\neXamPle 10-18: Show that the single-replacement reaction between \\ncopper metal and silver nitrate described by the chemical equation\\n\\nCu(s) + 2 AgNO3(aq) → Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2 Ag(s)\\n\\nis an oxidation-reduction reaction. Which atom is oxidized and which atom \\nis reduced in this reaction?\\n\\nSolution: The ionic charge on copper metal, Cu(s), is 0. Because the nitrate \\npolyatomic anion, NO3–(aq), has an ionic charge of –1 (Table 10.1), we \\nconclude that the copper ion in Cu(NO3)2(aq) must have an ionic charge of \\n+2 (recall from Chapter 6 that copper ions commonly have a +1 or +2 ionic \\ncharge in compounds). Therefore, the ionic charge of the copper atom \\nchanges from 0 to +2 in this reaction.\\n\\nThe ionic charge of the silver ion in silver nitrate, AgNO3(aq), is +1 \\n(recall from Chapter 6 that the ionic charge of silver is +1 in most com-\\npounds), and the ionic charge of silver metal, Ag(s), is 0.

In this reaction, the cop-\\nper atom gives up two electrons and each of the two silver ions gains an \\nelectron. Thus, the copper atom is oxidized and the silver ion is reduced. \\nNotice that both the elements involved and the electrons transferred in this \\nreaction equation are balanced, as they must be.\\n\\nPRaCtiCe PRoblem 10-18: Determine which of the reactions \\ndescribed by the chemical equations below are oxidation-reduction  \\nreactions:\\n\\n(a) 2 Fe(s) + 3 Cl2(g) → 2 FeCl3(s)\\n\\n(b) 2 AgNO3(aq) + Na2S(aq) → Ag2S(s) + 2 NaNO3(aq)\\n\\n(c) Zn(s) + HgCl2(aq) → ZnCl2(aq) + Hg(l)\\n\\nAnswer: (a) and (c) are oxidation-reduction reactions.\\n\\nIn an oxidation-reduction reaction, the substance that supplies electrons, \\nor the electron donor, is called the reducing agent.

Many important chemical processes involve oxidation-re-\\nduction reactions (Figure 10.26). We shall devote an entire chapter to oxida-\\ntion-reduction reactions later on (Chapter 24).\\n\\nOne of the most difficult challenges that a beginning student of chemis-\\ntry faces is predicting the products of a chemical reaction when only the reac-\\ntants are given. This question is often difficult even for a trained chemist. The \\nclassification of reaction types presented in this chapter is a helpful start in \\nthis regard, but one still requires additional chemical experience to develop \\nconfidence. As you see more chemical reactions throughout this book, think \\nabout each one and try to classify it according to the schemes developed in this  \\nchapter.\\n\\nSummaRy\\nMany chemical reactions can be classified as being one of four types:\\n\\n 1.   Combination reaction: a reaction of two substances to form a single  \\nproduct.\\n\\n 2.   Decomposition reaction: a reaction in which a substance breaks down into \\ntwo or more simpler substances.\\n\\n 3.   Single-replacement reaction: a reaction involving the substitution of one \\nelement in a compound by another (also called a substitution reaction).\\n\\nFigure 10.26 The sulfur deposits that \\noccur around hot springs usually result \\nfrom the oxidation-reduction reaction \\nbetween sulfur dioxide and hydrogen \\nsulfide.\\n\\nSee Interchapter U at  \\nwww.McQuarrieGeneralChemistry.com.\\n\\n\\n\\n 4.   Double-replacement reaction: a reaction in which the cations of two ionic \\ncompounds exchange anionic partners. Double-replacement reactions \\nmay be divided into the following additional categories: reactions in which \\na precipitate is formed (the products of which may be predicted using \\nthe solubility rules), reactions in which a covalent compound is formed, \\nsuch as acid-base reactions that produce water, and reactions that produce  \\na gas.\\n\\nPolyatomic ions are covalently bonded ions that remain intact in water.  \\nTable 10.1 lists some chemically important examples of polyatomic ions.\\n\\nThe solubility rules (Table 10.9) predict if an ionic compound is soluble in \\nwater. These must be applied in order and may be used to predict which prod-\\nucts will precipitate out of solution during a reaction.\\n\\nAcids are substances that produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), when dissolved \\nin water; bases are substances that produce hydroxide ions, OH–(aq), when dis-\\nsolved in water. Three classes of acids are binary acids, oxyacids, and organic \\nacids. Acids and bases cause certain dyes to change color. For example, litmus \\nturns red in acidic solutions and blue in basic solutions. An acid and a base \\nreact with each other to produce water and a salt; such reactions are called neu-\\ntralization reactions. The naming of acids follows a simple set of rules.\\n\\nHydrates are formed by the combination of an anhydrous salt with water. \\nThe formation of hydrates is reversible and the waters of hydration may be \\ndriven off by heating. The formula of a hydrate is written with a dot between \\nthe anhydrous salt and the number of waters of hydration, and the name is writ-\\nten as the name of the salt plus the word hydrate using the appropriate Greek \\nprefix.\\n\\nData from single-replacement reactions can be used to order the metals in \\nterms of relative activity. The resulting activity series of the metals (Table 10.8) \\nis used to predict whether or not other single-replacement reactions involving \\nmetals occur. The nonmetals are too varied to allow a correspondingly simple \\nactivity series, but the relative activities of the halogens are F2 > Cl2 > Br2 > I2.\\n\\nReactions involving ions can be written in a compact form by using net ionic \\nequations. We obtain net ionic equations by canceling the spectator ions from \\nboth sides of the complete ionic equation.\\n\\nAll chemical reactions can be classified either as reactions that involve the \\ntransfer of electrons between reactants, called oxidation-reduction or redox \\nreactions, or as reactions that do not involve electron transfer. In an oxidation-\\nreduction reaction, electrons are transferred from the reducing agent, which \\ncontains the atom that is oxidized, to the oxidizing agent, which contains the \\natom that is reduced. Oxidation denotes a loss of electrons and reduction de-\\nnotes a gain of electrons. The number of electrons lost by the reducing agent \\nmust equal the number of electrons gained by the oxidizing agent.\\n\\nteRmS you Should knoW\\n\\nteRmS you Should knoW 339\\n\\ncombination reaction 308\\nvolatile 308\\ncombustion reaction 308\\npolyatomic ion 310\\noxyanion 311\\n\\nhydroxide ion, OH–(aq) 315\\nbase 315\\ninert 315\\nacid 315\\nhydrogen ion, H+(aq) 315\\n\\nhydronium ion, H3O+(aq) 315\\nacidic hydrogen atom 316\\nacidic proton 316\\nmonoprotic, diprotic, and \\n\\ntriprotic acids 316\\n\\n\\n\\n10.

Balance this equation.  \\n\\n\\n\\nJustus von Liebig (1803–1873) was born in Darmstadt, Germany, to a poor merchant family. He \\ndeveloped an interest in chemistry working in his father’s shop, where he experimented with \\nfulminates, a class of highly unstable and explosive compounds. This led him to be expelled \\nfrom middle school after he caused an explosion with some chemicals he brought to school. \\nAfter spending six months as an apprentice to a pharmacist and reading books on chemistry \\nborrowed from the open library of Duke Ludwig, he became an assistant to Professor Karl \\nWilhelm Kastner, who saw that Liebig received a formal education and an honorary doctoral \\ndegree. Liebig went on to learn analytical techniques in Paris that led to an appointment \\nas a professor at the University of Giessen at just 21 years of age. At Giessen, he stressed the \\nimportance of a laboratory component to a chemical education and under state patronage \\nbuilt the first modern teaching laboratory, complete with fume hoods, from an old army \\nbarracks. As his reputation grew, hundreds of chemistry students came to study under him, \\nthus disseminating his new experimental approach to teaching. Among his great achievements, \\nLiebig perfected the technique for rapid elemental analysis using combustion analysis that is still \\nin use today; he was the founder of agricultural chemistry; and his work in chemical analysis laid \\nthe foundation upon which modern organic chemistry is built. Because of his irascible nature \\nand hot temper, Liebig alienated many scientific friends and made many enemies. He had \\nfew interests outside of chemistry. It is an ironic twist of history that Justus von Liebig, a great \\nchemistry teacher to whom many Nobel Laureates trace their scientific genealogy, was both \\nexpelled from middle school and never completed his own doctoral dissertation.\\n\\n\\n\\n349\\n\\n11. Chemical Calculations\\n\\nIn the last chapter, we learned to treat chemical reactions qualitatively. We saw how atoms, molecules, and ions can react with one another to form new \\ncompounds, and we discussed how chemists classify many common types of re-\\nactions. In this chapter we shall learn how to treat chemical reactions quantita-\\ntively. We shall see how we can use chemical calculations to predict the amount \\nof a compound that can be prepared from a given initial quantity of reactants. \\nWe also learn to predict how much reactant should be used to obtain a specified \\namount of product. The basis for all such chemical calculations is the funda-\\nmental concept of a mole (one of the most important ideas in chemistry) and \\nthe balanced chemical equation that describes a reaction.\\n\\n11-1.  The Quantity of a Substance That is Equal  \\nto Its Formula Mass in Grams Is Called a Mole\\n\\nWe learned in Chapter 2 that the atomic mass of an element is a relative quan-\\ntity; it is the mass of one atom of the element relative to the mass of one atom of \\ncarbon-12, which by convention has a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass units, or \\n12 u. Consider the following table of four elements:\\n\\n\\t Element\\t Atomic\\tmass/u\\n\\n helium, He 4\\n\\n carbon, C 12\\n\\n titanium, Ti 48\\n\\n molybdenum, Mo 96\\n\\nThis table shows that\\n\\n •  One carbon atom has a mass three times that of one helium atom.\\n •  One titanium atom has a mass four times that of one carbon atom and 12 \\n\\ntimes that of one helium atom.\\n •  One molybdenum atom has a mass twice that of one titanium atom, eight \\n\\ntimes that of one carbon atom, and 24 times that of one helium atom.\\n\\n 11-1  The Concept of a Mole\\n\\n 11-2  Avogadro’s Number\\n\\n 11-3  Simplest Formula\\n\\n 11-4  Determination of Atomic Mass\\n\\n 11-5  Molecular Formulas\\n\\n 11-6  Combustion Analysis\\n\\n11-7  Coefficients in Chemical Equations\\n\\n11-8  Stoichiometry\\n\\n11-9  Stoichiometry Without Chemical \\n\\nEquations\\n\\n11-10  Limiting Reactant\\n\\n11-11  Percentage Yield\\n\\n\\n\\n11. ChEMICaL CaLCuLaTIonS350\\n\\nIt is important to realize that we have not deduced the absolute mass of any \\none atom; at this point we can determine only relative masses based on our ar-\\nbitrarily defined scale of carbon-12 equals 12 atomic mass units (12 u).\\n\\nConsider 12 grams of carbon, 48 grams of titanium, and 96 grams of mo-\\nlybdenum (Figure 11.1). One titanium atom has a mass four times that of one \\ncarbon atom; therefore, 48 grams of titanium atoms must contain the same \\nnumber of atoms as 12 grams of carbon. Similarly, one molybdenum atom has \\ntwice the mass of one titanium atom, so 96 grams of molybdenum must contain \\nthe same number of atoms as 48 grams of titanium. We conclude that 12 grams \\nof carbon, 48 grams of titanium, and 96 grams of molybdenum all contain \\nthe same number of atoms. If we continue this line of reasoning, we find that \\nexactly the same number of atoms is contained in that quantity of an atomic \\nelement whose mass in grams is numerically equal to the element’s atomic mass. \\nThus, we find from the atomic masses given on the periodic table on the inside \\nfront cover that 10.8 grams of boron, 23.0 grams of sodium, 63.6 grams of cop-\\nper, and 200.6 grams of mercury all contain the same number of atoms.\\n\\nAll the substances we have considered here so far are atomic substances, \\nthat is, substances composed of only one type of atom. Now consider the follow-\\ning molecular\\tsubstances:\\n\\nSubstance\\t Molecular\\tmass/u\\n\\nmethane, CH4 12 + (4 × 1) = 16\\n\\noxygen, O2 2 × 16 = 32\\n\\n ozone, O3 3 × 16 = 48\\n\\nLike atomic masses, molecular masses are relative masses. A molecule of \\noxygen, O2, has a mass of 32 u, twice that of a molecule of methane, 16 u. A mol-\\necule of ozone has a mass of 48 u, three times that of a molecule of methane. \\nUsing the same reasoning we used for atomic substances, we conclude that 16 \\ngrams of methane, 32 grams of oxygen, and 48 grams of ozone must all contain \\nthe same number of molecules. In addition, because the atomic mass of titanium \\nis equal to the molecular mass of ozone, the number of atoms in 48 grams of \\ntitanium must equal the number of molecules in 48 grams of ozone.\\n\\nWe can eliminate the necessity of using the two separate terms atomic mass \\nand molecular mass by using the single term formula\\tmass to cover both. Like-\\nwise, a formula\\tunit can refer to an atom, a molecule, or an ion. We now can ex-\\ntend our previous statement to say that identical numbers of formula units are \\ncontained in those quantities of different substances whose masses in grams are \\nnumerically equal to their respective formula masses. Thus, 4 grams of helium, \\n12 grams of carbon, 16 grams of methane, and 32 grams of oxygen all contain \\nthe same number of formula units. The formula units are atoms in the cases of \\nhelium and carbon, and molecules in the cases of methane and oxygen.\\n\\nTo aid in chemical calculations, chemists use a unit called a mole. The quan-\\ntity of a substance whose mass in grams is numerically equal to the formula mass of the \\nsubstance is called a mole. The abbreviation for mole is mol and is often used \\nwhenever a specific quantity of moles is written, for example, 3.12 mol CH4(g). \\nThe molar\\tmass of a compound is the number of grams needed to make up \\none mole of the compound. For example, methane, CH4(g), has a formula mass \\n\\n12 g Carbon\\n\\n48 g Titanium\\n\\n96 g Molybdenum\\n\\nFigure 11.1 12 grams of carbon contains \\nthe same number of atoms as 48 \\ngrams of titanium and 96 grams of \\nmolybdenum.\\n\\n\\n\\n35111-1.

Figure 11.2 \\nshows one mole of each of six common substances.\\n\\nAs you perform chemical calculations, you will often need to convert be-\\ntween mass and moles. For example, the formula mass of CH4(g) is 16.04, so \\nthere are 16.04 grams per mole of methane. This fact yields two unit conversion \\nfactors:\\n\\n= 1 or\\n1 mol CH4\\n—\\n16.04 g CH4\\n\\n� � = 116.04 g CH4—1 mol CH4� �\\nThe factor with mass in grams in the denominator may be used to convert from \\ngrams to moles of CH4(g), and its inverse with moles in the denominator to \\nconvert from moles of CH4(g) to mass in grams.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you needed to know the number of moles in 50.0 \\ngrams of methane. Using the unit conversion factor with the mass in grams in \\nthe denominator, we find\\n\\n= 3.12 mol CH4moles of CH4 = (50.0 g CH4)\\n\\n3 significant\\nfigures\\n\\n3 significant\\nfigures4 significant\\n\\nfigures (1 is exact)\\n\\n1 mol CH4\\n—\\n16.04 g CH4\\n\\n� �\\n\\nNotice that the result is expressed to three significant figures and assigned the \\nunits moles of CH4(g), as required.\\n\\nYou can also calculate the mass of a certain number of moles of a substance. \\nFor example, let’s calculate the mass of 2.16 moles of sodium chloride, NaCl(s). \\n\\nFigure 11.2 (Clockwise from far left) \\nMolar quantities of sulfur (32.1 grams), \\nsucrose (table sugar) (342.3 grams), \\ncopper sulfate pentahydrate (249.7 \\ngrams), sodium chloride (58.4 grams), \\ncopper (63.6 grams), and mercury(II) \\noxide (216.6 grams).

In order to calculate the num-\\nber of moles in a given mass of a chemical compound, it is necessary to know the \\nchemical formula of the compound. A mole of any compound is defined only \\nin terms of its chemical formula. If a substance (such as coal or wood) cannot \\nbe represented by a single chemical formula, then we can give only the mass of \\nthe substance.\\n\\n11-2.  one Mole of any Substance Contains  \\navogadro’s number of Formula units\\n\\nIt has been determined experimentally that one mole of any substance contains \\n6.022 × 1023 formula units (to four significant figures). This number is called \\nAvogadro’s\\tnumber after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro, who was one \\nof the earliest scientists to distinguish between atoms and molecules (Chap-\\nter 13 Frontispiece). We say not only that one mole of any substance contains \\nAvogadro’s number of formula units but also that one mole is that mass of a \\nsubstance containing Avogadro’s number of formula units, or “elementary enti-\\nties.” For example, the atomic mass of the pure isotope carbon-12 is taken to  \\nbe exactly 12, so 12.00 grams of carbon-12 contains 6.022 × 1023 atoms. \\nLikewise, the molecular mass of water is 18.02, so 18.02 grams of water contains \\n6.022 × 1023 molecules.\\n\\nA mole is simply a designation for Avogadro’s number of “things” such as \\natoms and molecules, just as a dozen of eggs is a designation for twelve eggs. It \\nis often helpful to think of one mole as a “counting unit” representing Avoga-\\ndro’s number of things, just as one dozen is a counting unit representing twelve \\nthings. But instead of the number 12 implied by the term dozen, the number \\nof things in a mole is 6.022 × 1023. A mole may be more intimidating because \\nof the huge magnitude of Avogadro’s number, but it is really the same concept \\nas a dozen. A mole of eggs would be 6.022 × 1023 eggs, but it is not a practical \\nmeasure of the number of eggs. A mole of atoms or molecules, on the other \\nhand, is a practical measure of the number of atoms or molecules in a substance \\nbecause of their small size. A few examples of things that we count in chemistry \\nusing moles are given in Table 11.1.\\n\\nWe now have an alternative definition for a mole: One mole is the mass of a \\nsubstance containing Avogadro’s number of formula units.

ChEMICaL CaLCuLaTIonS354\\n\\nTable 11.1, one mole of aluminum atoms may be expressed as either 6.022 × 1023 \\naluminum atoms or 26.98 grams of aluminum. The formula mass of a substance \\nis the mass in grams of one mole or 6.022 × 1023 formula units. That is,\\n\\n1 mol Al = 6.022 × 1023 Al atoms = 26.98 g Al\\n\\nAvogadro’s number is an enormous number. If we were to express  \\nAvogadro’s number without using scientific notation, we would have  \\n602 200 000 000 000 000 000 000. In order to appreciate the magnitude of Avo-\\ngadro’s number another way, let’s compute how many years it would take to \\nspend Avogadro’s number of dollars at a rate of one million dollars per second. \\nBecause there are 3.15 × 107 seconds in one year, the number of years required \\nto spend 6.022 × 1023 dollars is\\n\\n= 1.91 × 1010 years\\n\\nnumber of years = (6.022 × 1023 dollars)\\n1 year\\n—\\n3.15 × 107 s\\n\\n1 s\\n—\\n106 dollars �� ��\\n\\nor 19.1 billion years (1 billion = 109). This interval is over four times longer than \\nthe estimated age of the earth (4.6 billion years) and is somewhat larger than \\nthe estimated age of the universe (14 billion years). This calculation illustrates \\njust how large Avogadro’s number is and, consequently, how small atoms and \\nmolecules are. Look again at the samples in Figure 11.2. Each of these contains \\n6.022 × 1023 formula units of the indicated substance.\\n\\nWe can use Avogadro’s number to calculate the mass of a single atom or \\nmolecule, as illustrated by the following Example.\\n\\n \\n\\nEXaMpLE 11-2: Using Avogadro’s number, calculate the mass of one \\nnitrogen molecule.\\n\\nSolution: Recall that nitrogen occurs as a diatomic molecule. The formula \\nof molecular nitrogen is N2, so its formula mass, or molecular mass, is \\n28.02. Thus, there are 28.02 grams of nitrogen in one mole.

We now introduce another fundamental concept in our study of \\nchemistry, that of stoichiometry (stoi´ke om´i tre). Stoichiometry is the calcula-\\ntion of the quantities of elements or compounds involved in chemical reactions. \\nThe word stoichiometry is derived from the Greek words stoicheio, meaning “sim-\\nplest components or parts,” and metrein, meaning “to measure.” The concept of \\na mole is central to carrying out stoichiometric calculations.\\n\\nFor example, we can use the concept of a mole to determine the simplest \\n\\n\\t Substance\\t Formula\\t Formula\\t Molar\\tmass/\\t Number\\tof\\tparticles\\t Number\\tof\\tmoles\\t\\n\\t \\t \\t \\t\\t\\tmass\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tg·mol–1\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin\\tone\\tmole\\n\\n atomic chlorine Cl 35.45 35.45 6.022 × 1023 chlorine atoms 1 mole of Cl atoms\\n\\n chlorine gas Cl2 70.90 70.90 6.022 × 1023 chlorine molecules 1 mole of Cl2 molecules\\n\\n     12.044 × 1023 chlorine atoms 2 moles of Cl atoms\\n\\n water H2O 18.02 18.02 6.022 × 1023 water molecules 1 mole of H2O molecules\\n\\n     12.044 × 1023 hydrogen atoms 2 moles of H atoms\\n\\n     6.022 × 1023 oxygen atoms 1 mole of O atoms\\n\\n sodium chloride NaCl 58.44 58.44 6.022 × 1023 NaCl formula units 1 mole of NaCl   \\n      formula units\\n\\n     6.022 × 1023 sodium ions 1 mole of Na+ ions\\n\\n     6.022 × 1023 chloride ions 1 mole of Cl– ions\\n\\n barium fluoride BaF2 175.3 175.3 6.022 × 1023 BaF2 formula units 1 mole of BaF2 \\n      formula units\\n\\n     6.022 × 1023 barium ions 1 mole of Ba2+ ions\\n\\n     12.044 × 1023 fluoride ions 2 moles of F– ions\\n\\n nitrate ion NO3– 62.01 62.01 6.022 × 1023 nitrate ions 1 mole of NO3– ions\\n\\n     6.022 × 1023 nitrogen atoms 1 mole of N atoms\\n\\n     18.066 × 1023 oxygen atoms 3 moles of O atoms\\n\\nTaBLE 11.2 Representative relationships between molar quantities\\n\\n\\n\\nchemical formula of a substance. Zinc oxide is found by chemical analysis to \\nbe 80.3 percent (by mass) zinc and 19.7 percent (by mass) oxygen. When work-\\ning with mass percentages in chemical calculations, it is convenient to consider \\na 100-gram sample so that the mass percentages can be converted easily to \\ngrams. For example, a 100-gram sample of zinc oxide contains 80.3 grams of \\nzinc and 19.7 grams of oxygen. We can write this schematically as\\n\\n80.3 g Zn \\ue0a4 19.7 g O\\n\\nwhere the symbol \\ue0a4 means “is stoichiometrically\\tequivalent\\tto” or, in this case, \\n“combines with.” If we divide 80.3 grams of zinc by the atomic mass of zinc \\n(65.41), we find that\\n\\nmoles of Zn = (80.3 g Zn) = 1.23 mol Zn\\n1 mol Zn\\n—\\n65.41 g Zn� �\\n\\nand if we divide 19.7 grams of oxygen by the atomic mass of oxygen (16.00), we \\nobtain\\n\\nmoles of O = (19.7 g O) = 1.23 mol O\\n1 mol O\\n—\\n16.00 g O� �\\n\\nThus, we have\\n\\n1.23 mol Zn \\ue0a4 1.23 mol O\\n\\nor, dividing both sides of this expression by 1.23,\\n\\n1.00 mol Zn \\ue0a4 1.00 mol O\\n\\nBecause 1.00 mole corresponds to Avogadro’s number of atoms, we can divide \\nboth sides by Avogadro’s number and get\\n\\n1.00 atom of Zn \\ue0a4 1.00 atom of O\\n\\nThis expression says that one atom of zinc combines with one atom of oxygen \\nand that the simplest\\tformula of zinc oxide is therefore ZnO. We call ZnO the \\nsimplest chemical formula of zinc oxide because chemical analysis provides us \\nwith only the ratios of atoms in a chemical formula and not the actual number \\nof atoms. Mass percentages alone cannot be used to distinguish among ZnO, \\nZn2O2, Zn3O3, or any other multiple of the formula ZnO.

Empirical Formulas Can Be used to  \\ndetermine an unknown atomic Mass\\n\\nIf we know the empirical formula of a compound, then we can determine the \\natomic mass of one of the elements in the compound if the atomic masses of the \\nother elements in the compound are known. This determination is a standard \\nexperiment in many general chemistry laboratory courses.\\n\\nEXaMpLE 11-6: The empirical formula of a metal oxide is MO, where M \\nstands for the chemical symbol of the metal.

Given that the atomic mass of oxygen is \\n16.00, determine the atomic mass of the metal.\\n\\nSolution: The mass of oxygen in the metal oxide is\\n\\nmass of O in oxide = 0.813 g MO – 0.490 g M = 0.323 g O\\n\\nThe number of moles of O is\\n\\nmoles of O = (0.323 g O)� = 0.0202 mol O1 mol O—16.00 g O�\\nThe empirical formula MO tells us that 0.0202 moles of M are combined \\nwith 0.0202 moles of O.

A 3.058-gram sample of the metal is burned in oxygen, and the M2O3 \\nproduced is found to have a mass of 4.111 grams. Given that the atomic \\nmass of oxygen is 16.00, determine the atomic mass of the metal. What is \\nthe metal?\\n\\nAnswer: 69.70; gallium\\n\\nYou can see from these examples that it is possible to determine the empiri-\\ncal formula of a compound if the atomic masses are known, and that it is pos-\\nsible to determine the atomic mass of an element if the empirical formula of \\none of its compounds and the atomic masses of the other elements that make \\nup the compound are known. We are faced with a dilemma here. Atomic masses \\ncan be determined if empirical formulas are known (Example 11-6), but atomic \\nmasses must be known to determine empirical formulas (Examples 11-4 and \\n11-5). This was a serious problem in the early 1800s, shortly after Dalton for-\\nmulated his atomic theory. At the time, it was necessary to guess the empirical \\nformula of a compound—even though an incorrect guess led to an incorrect \\natomic mass. In fact, many of the atomic masses originally proposed by Dalton \\nwere in error for exactly this reason. We show in Chapter 13 that it was the quan-\\ntitative study of gases and of reactions between gases that provided the key for \\nresolving the difficulty in determining reliable values of atomic masses. Today \\nmass spectrometry (Section 2-11) allows for the direct determination of atomic \\nmasses, so ambiguities no longer exist in the table of atomic masses.\\n\\n11-5.  an Empirical Formula along With the Molecular Mass \\ndetermines the Molecular Formula\\n\\nSuppose that the chemical analysis of a compound gives 85.7% carbon and \\n14.3% hydrogen by mass. We then have\\n\\n85.7 g C \\ue0a4 14.3 g H\\n7.14 mol C \\ue0a4 14.2 mol H\\n\\n1 mol C \\ue0a4 2 mol H\\n\\nand conclude that the empirical formula is CH2. However, the actual formula, \\nthe molecular\\tformula, might be C2H4, C3H6, or, generally, CnH2n for any whole \\nnumber n. The chemical analysis gives us only ratios of the number of atoms. \\nIf we know the molecular mass from another experiment, however, we can de-\\ntermine the molecular formula unambiguously. For example, suppose we know \\nthat the molecular mass of our compound, as determined from other experi-\\nments, is 42. By listing the various possible formulas, all of which have the em-\\npirical formula CH2,\\n\\n11-5. ThE MoLECuLaR FoRMuLa Can BE dETERMInEd FRoM an EMpIRICaL FoRMuLa 361\\n\\n\\n\\n11.

The \\nmolecular formula of the compound is therefore C3H6. You can understand \\nnow why the empirical formula deduced from chemical analysis is also called \\nthe simplest formula. It must be supplemented by molecular mass data to deter-\\nmine the molecular formula.\\n\\nNote that the molecular formula in the above example is “three times” the \\nempirical formula.

The Coefficients in Chemical Equations Can Be  \\nInterpreted as numbers of Moles\\n\\nA subject of great practical importance in chemistry is the determination of \\nwhat quantity of product can be obtained from a given quantity of reactants. \\nFor example, the reaction between hydrogen and nitrogen to produce ammo-\\nnia, NH3(g), can be described by the equation\\n\\n 3 H2(g) + N2(g) → 2 NH3(g) (11.1)\\n\\nwhere the coefficients in the equation are called balancing\\tcoefficients or stoi-\\nchiometric\\tcoefficients. We might wish to know how much NH3(g) is produced \\n\\n\\n\\nwhen 10.0 grams of N2(g) reacts with excess H2(g). Recall from Section 3-2 that \\nwe can interpret the balancing coefficients in a chemical equation in a number \\nof ways. To determine how much of one substance can be obtained from an-\\nother, we interpret the equation in terms of moles. Thus, we interpret Equation \\n11.1 as\\n\\n3 mol H2(g) + 1 mol N2(g) → 2 mol NH3(g)\\n\\nThis result is important. It tells us that the stoichiometric or balancing coeffi-\\ncients are the relative numbers of moles of each substance in a balanced chemi-\\ncal equation.\\n\\nWe can also interpret the hydrogen-nitrogen reaction in terms of masses. \\nIf we convert moles to masses by multiplying by the appropriate molar masses, \\nthen we get\\n\\n6.05 g H2(g) + 28.02 g N2(g) → 34.07 g NH3(g)\\n\\nNote that the total mass is the same on the two sides of the equation, in ac-\\ncord with the law of conservation of mass. Table 11.3 summarizes the various \\ninterpretations of the equation for the reaction of hydrogen with nitrogen to \\nproduce ammonia as well as that of the reaction of sodium with chlorine to \\nproduce sodium chloride.\\n\\nWe are now ready to calculate how much ammonia is produced when a \\ngiven quantity of nitrogen or hydrogen is used.

Thus, there is excess sulfur; only 0.0178 moles of \\nsulfur react and (0.0624 – 0.0178) moles = 0.0446 moles of sulfur remain after \\nthe reaction is completed. The cadmium reacts completely, and the number of \\nmoles of cadmium consumed determines how much CdS(s) is produced. The \\nreactant that is consumed completely and thereby limits the amount of product \\nformed is called the limiting\\treactant, and any other reactants are called excess\\t\\nreactants. In this example, cadmium is the limiting reactant and sulfur is in \\nexcess. Because the limiting reactant is completely consumed while the excess \\nreactant is not, the initial mass of the limiting reactant must be used to calcu-\\nlate how much product is formed.\\n\\nIn Equation 11.3, 0.0178 moles of cadmium react with 0.0178 moles of sulfur \\nto produce 0.0178 moles of CdS(s).

Thus, Fe2O3(s) is the limiting reactant and the one that we \\nshould use to calculate the amount of iron produced.

For Many Chemical Reactions the amount of the desired \\nproduct obtained Is Less Than the Theoretical amount\\n\\nIn all the Examples considered up to now, we have assumed that the amount of \\nproducts produced can be calculated from the complete reaction of the limit-\\ning reactant. However, it frequently happens that less than this theoretical\\tyield \\nof product is obtained because (1) the reaction may fail to go to completion; \\n(2) there may be side reactions that give rise to undesired products; (3) some \\nof the desired product may not be readily recoverable or may be lost in the puri-\\nfication process; or (4) the original reactants may be impure or contaminated. \\n\\nFigure 11.10 Thermite reaction. \\nA spectacular example of a single-\\nreplacement reaction is the reaction \\nbetween powdered aluminum metal \\nand iron(III) oxide described by  \\nthe equation\\n\\n2 Al(s) + Fe2O3(s) → 2 Fe(l) + Al2O3(s)\\nOnce this reaction is initiated by a heat \\nsource such as a burning magnesium \\nribbon, it proceeds vigorously, pro- \\nducing so much heat that the iron is \\nformed as a liquid.\\n\\nFigure 11.11 The Mars Reconnaissance \\nOrbiter (MRO) was positioned over the \\nsurface of Mars using rocket engines \\npowered by a stoichiometric mixture \\nof hydrazine, N2H4(l), and dinitrogen \\ntetroxide, N2O4(l).\\n\\n\\n\\nIn these instances, the mass of the product that actually is obtained is called \\nthe actual\\tyield, and the efficiency of conversion of reactants into recovered \\nproducts can be expressed as the percentage\\tyield (% yield).

Let’s calculate the percentage yield \\nof CH3OH(l). 1 metric ton equals 1 × 106 grams, and so the theoretical yield is\\n\\na QuICK METhod FoR FIndInG LIMITInG REaCTanTS. \\nA quick method for determining which species, if any, is a limiting reac-\\ntant is to divide the number of moles of each reactant by its stoichiomet-\\nric coefficient in the balanced chemical equation. The reactant with the \\nleast number of moles divided by its stoichiometric coefficient is a limiting \\nreactant. For instance, in Example 11-15 we had to determine whether \\n25.0 grams of Al(s) or 58.0 grams of Fe2O3(s) was a limiting reactant in \\nthe thermite reaction. We then found that these masses corresponded to \\n0.363 moles of Fe2O3(s) and 0.927 moles of Al(s). Let’s use the stoichiomet-\\nric coefficients of the two reactants in the balanced chemical equation,\\n\\nFe2O3(s) + 2 Al(s) → Al2O3(s) + 2 Fe(l)\\n\\nto determine which, if either, of these is a limiting reactant. Dividing the \\nnumber of moles of each of these species by its stoichiometric coefficient \\ngives\\n\\n= 0.464 mol\\n0.927 mol Al\\n—\\n\\n2\\n\\nand\\n\\n= 0.363 mol\\n0.363 mol Fe2O3—\\n\\n1\\n\\nBecause the number of moles of Fe2O3(s) divided by it stoichiometric co-\\nefficient is less than the number of moles of Al(s) divided by its stoichio-\\nmetric coefficient, we conclude that Fe2O3(s) is a limiting reactant. This \\nmethod is particularly useful for working problems involving more than \\ntwo reactants.\\n\\n11-11. ThE aCTuaL yIELd May BE LESS Than ThE ThEoRETICaL yIELd 381\\n\\n\\n\\n11.

In order to calculate the number of \\nmoles in a given mass of a substance, it is necessary to know its chemical for-\\nmula. Another definition of a mole is the mass of a substance that contains \\nAvogadro’s number (6.022 × 1023) of formula units or elementary entities. The \\nmole can be described as a counting unit, similar to a dozen. The mole concept \\nis central to our study of chemistry.\\n\\nStoichiometric calculations are based on the concept of a mole. We use the \\nidea of a mole to determine chemical formulas from chemical analysis. One of \\nthe oldest techniques of chemical analysis is combustion analysis, from which we \\ncan determine the empirical formula of a compound. If we know the molecular \\nmass from another experiment, we can then determine the molecular formula \\nas well. The molecular formula is usually insufficient for determining chemical \\nstructure, which is generally determined using various spectroscopic methods.\\n\\nThe mole concept is also central to chemical calculations. By interpreting \\nthe balancing coefficients in chemical equations in terms of moles, we can use \\nchemical equations to calculate quantities of substances involved in chemical \\nreactions. For example, we can calculate how much product can be obtained \\nfrom a given amount of reactant, or how much reactant to use to obtain a given \\namount of product. Finally, percentage yields are a measure of how much prod-\\nuct is actually formed in a given experiment.\\n\\nTERMS you ShouLd KnoW\\natomic substances 350\\nmolecular substances 350\\nformula mass 350\\nformula unit 350\\nmole (mol) 350\\nmolar mass 350\\nAvogadro’s number 353\\nstoichiometry 356\\nstoichiometrically \\n\\nequivalent to (\\ue0a4) 357\\n\\nsimplest formula 357\\nempirical formula 357\\nmolecular formula 361\\nhydrocarbon 362\\ncombustion analysis 364\\nbalancing coefficient 366\\nstoichiometric coefficient 366\\nstoichiometric unit conversion \\n\\nfactor 367\\nmetric ton 375\\n\\nlimiting reactant 378\\nexcess reactant 378\\nthermite reaction 380\\ntheoretical yield 380\\nactual yield 381\\npercentage yield (% yield) 381\\n\\n \\nan EQuaTIon you ShouLd KnoW hoW To uSE\\n\\n% yield = × 100\\nactual yield\\n—\\ntheoretical yield� �        (11.4) (calculation of percentage yield)\\n\\nan EQuaTIon you ShouLd KnoW hoW To uSE 383\\n\\n\\n\\n11.

His high-school \\nprincipal, recognizing that Hildebrand knew more chemistry than he did, gave him a copy \\nof his Harvard chemistry textbook and the keys to the lab. Through a series of experiments, \\nHildebrand systematically determined that many of the assertions in the text were wrong. This \\nhad a profound effect on him and sparked his interest in performing research. He attended \\nthe University of Pennsylvania, earning a bachelor’s degree in 1903 and a Ph.D. in chemistry in \\n1906. He then traveled to Europe, attending lectures at various universities, and then returned \\nto the University of Pennsylvania in 1907. In 1913, he was offered a position by G. N. Lewis at the \\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, where he worked for the next 65 years, publishing some 280 \\nresearch papers (more than half after his “retirement”). One of his most famous achievements \\nwas solving the problem of “the bends” in diving—where dissolved nitrogen would bubble out \\nof the blood during decompression—by replacing nitrogen with the less-soluble helium in \\nbreathing mixtures. Hildebrand packed lecture halls with students attending his lively lectures \\nand demonstrations. He served as president of the American Chemical Society in 1955, and in \\n1962 was awarded its highest scientific honor, the Priestly Medal. Hildebrand was also an active \\noutdoors enthusiast. In 1921, he taught himself to ski and managed the United States ski team \\nat the 1936 Winter Olympics. He wrote books on camping and mountain climbing and from \\n1937 to 1940 was president of the Sierra Club.

Chemical Calculations for Solutions\\n\\nMost chemical and biological processes take place in solution, particularly in aqueous solution. In this chapter we discuss how to carry out a number \\nof calculations for chemical reactions that take place in solution. First we discuss \\nwhat a solution is, then we discuss ways to calculate the concentrations of the \\ncomponents of a solution. Concentration can be expressed in a variety of units, \\nbut by far the most important unit of concentration in chemistry is molarity. We \\nshall use molarity to carry out stoichiometric calculations for reactions where \\none or more of the reactants or products occurs in solution. Finally, we briefly \\ndiscuss titration experiments involving acid-base neutralization reactions.\\n\\n12-1.  A Solution Is a Homogeneous Mixture of  \\nTwo or More Substances\\n\\nAs we have seen in Section 2-3, a solution is a mixture that is homogeneous at \\nthe molecular level. From a molecular point of view, the species in a solution \\nare uniformly dispersed among one another (Figure 12.1). The components \\nof a solution are the pure substances that are mixed to form the solution. The \\ncomponents do not have to be a solid and a liquid; there are many types of solu-\\ntions (Table 12.1).\\n\\nThe most common type of solution is a solid dissolved in a liquid. The solid \\nthat is dissolved is called the solute, and the liquid in which it is dissolved is \\ncalled the solvent. The terms solvent and solute are merely terms of convenience \\nbecause all the components of a solution are uniformly dispersed throughout \\nthe solution. When NaCl(s) is dissolved in water, we say that NaCl(s) is the \\nsolute and H2O(l) is the solvent. The process of dissolving NaCl(s) in water is \\nrepresented by the equation\\n\\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ Na+(aq) + Cl–(aq)   NaCl(s) H2O(l)\\n\\nwhere H2O(l) under the arrow tells us that water is the solvent. The species \\nNa+(aq) and Cl–(aq) represent a sodium ion and a chloride ion in an aqueous \\nsolution. As Figure 12.2 illustrates, these ions are solvated by water molecules; \\nthat is, they are surrounded by a loosely bound shell of water molecules.\\n\\n 12-1  Solutions\\n\\n 12-2  Molarity\\n\\n 12-3  Electrolytes\\n\\n 12-4  Reactions in Solution\\n\\n 12-5  Precipitation Reactions\\n\\n 12-6  Acid-Base Titrations\\n\\n 12-7  Formula Mass from Titration Data\\n\\n\\n\\n12. CHeMICAl CAlCulATIonS for SoluTIonS394\\n\\nWhen a small quantity of sodium chloride is added to a beaker of water, the \\nsodium chloride dissolves completely, leaving no crystals at the bottom of the \\nbeaker. As more and more sodium chloride is added, we reach a point where no \\nmore sodium chloride can dissolve, so that any further sodium chloride crystals \\nthat we add simply remain at the bottom of the beaker. Such a solution is called \\na saturated solution, and the maximum quantity of solute dissolved is called \\nthe solubility of that solute. Solubility can be expressed in a variety of units, but \\nquite commonly it is expressed as grams of solute per 100 grams of solvent. For \\nexample, we can say that the solubility of NaCl(s) in water at 20˚C is about 36 \\ngrams per 100 grams of H2O(l).\\n\\nIt is important to realize that the solubility of a substance is the maximum \\nquantity that can be dissolved in a saturated solution at a particular temper-\\nature. The solubility of NaCl(s) at 20˚C is about 36 grams per 100 grams of \\nH2O(l). If we add 50 grams of NaCl(s) to 100 grams of H2O(l) at 20˚C, then \\n36 grams dissolve and 14 grams are left as undissolved NaCl(s). The solution is \\n\\nfigure 12.1 A solution is a \\nhomogeneous mixture at the molecular \\nlevel.

If we add 25 grams of NaCl(s) to 100 grams of H2O(l), then all the \\nNaCl(s) dissolves to form what is called an unsaturated solution; that is, a solu-\\ntion in which we can dissolve more of the solute.\\n\\nIn most cases the solubility of a substance depends on temperature. The ef-\\nfect of temperature on the solubility of several salts in water is shown in Figure \\n12.3. Almost all substances become more soluble in water as the temperature \\nincreases. For example, potassium nitrate is about five times more soluble in \\nwater at 40˚C than it is at 0˚C.\\n\\n12-2. Molarity Is the Most Common unit of Concentration\\n\\nThe concentration of solute in a solution describes the quantity of solute dis-\\nsolved in a given quantity of solvent or a given quantity of solution. A common \\nmethod of expressing the concentration of a solute is molarity, which is de-\\nnoted by the symbol M. Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute per \\nliter of solution:\\n\\n \\nmolarity =\\n\\nmoles of solute\\n—\\nliters of solution  \\n\\n(12.1)\\n\\nEquation 12.1 can be expressed symbolically as\\n\\n \\nM =\\n\\nn\\n—\\nV  \\n\\n(12.2)\\n\\nwhere M represents the molarity of the solution, n is the number of moles of \\nsolute dissolved in the solution, and V is the total volume of the solution in \\nliters. To see how to use Equation 12.2, let’s calculate the molarity of a solution \\nprepared by dissolving 62.3 grams of sucrose, C12H22O11(s), in enough water \\nto form 0.500 liters of solution. The formula mass of sucrose is 342.3, so 62.3 \\ngrams corresponds to\\n\\n= 0.182 molmoles of sucrose = (62.3 g sucrose)\\n1 mol sucrose\\n—\\n342.3 g sucrose� �\\n\\nThe molarity of the solution is given by\\n\\n= 0.364 mol·L–1 = 0.364 M=\\n0.182 mol\\n—\\n\\n0.500 L\\nM =\\n\\nn\\n—\\nV\\n\\nWe say that the concentration of sucrose in the solution is 0.364 molar, which \\nwe write as 0.364 M. The unit of molarity is written as M.\\n\\nThe definition of molarity involves the total volume of the solution, not just \\nthe volume of the solvent. Suppose we wish to prepare one liter of a 0.100-M \\naqueous solution of potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7(aq). We would prepare the \\nsolution by weighing out 0.100 moles (29.4 grams) of K2Cr2O7(s), dissolving it \\nin less than one liter of water, say, about 500 mL, and then adding water while \\nstirring until the final volume of the solution is precisely one liter. As shown \\nin Figure 12.4, we use a volumetric flask, which is a piece of glassware used to \\nprepare precise volumes. It would be incorrect to add 0.100 moles of K2Cr2O7(s) \\n\\nfigure 12.3 The solubility of most salts \\nincreases with increasing temperature.\\n\\nfigure 12.2 Ions in aqueous solutions \\nare surrounded by a loosely bound \\nshell of water molecules.

Solutions That Contain Ions Conduct an electric Current\\n\\nAs we have already seen in Section 6-1, when ionic substances dissolve, the crys-\\ntals separate into ions that are free to move about in solution and thus can con-\\nduct an electric current. In contrast, covalent compounds tend to yield neutral \\nmolecules when they dissolve in water and consequentially are poor conduc-\\ntors of an electric current. Ionic substances like sodium chloride, NaCl(s), or \\ncalcium chloride, CaCl2(s), whose aqueous solutions conduct an electric cur-\\nrent, are called electrolytes (Figure 12.6).

For example, although a 0.10 M HgCl2(aq) solution does conduct an \\nelectric current, it is a much poorer conductor of electricity than is a 0.10 M \\nCaCl2(aq) solution. For this reason, we call calcium chloride a strong electro-\\nlyte and mercury(II) chloride a weak electrolyte. When a strong electrolyte \\nsuch as calcium chloride dissolves in water, essentially all the calcium chloride \\nformula units dissociate (break up) in solution into free ions, which are avail-\\nable to conduct an electric current. However, when a weak electrolyte such as \\nmercury(II) chloride dissolves in water, only a small fraction of the mercury(II) \\nchloride formula units dissociate into ions; most exist as molecular mercury(II) \\nchloride units. Because a HgCl2(aq) solution contains far fewer ions to con-\\nduct a current than does a CaCl2(aq) solution of the same concentration, a \\nHgCl2(aq) solution is a poorer conductor than is a CaCl2(aq) solution at the \\nsame concentration.\\n\\nThe following simple rules can be used to predict whether a substance is a \\nstrong electrolyte, a weak electrolyte, or a nonelectrolyte.\\n\\n 1.   The acids HCl(aq), HBr(aq), HI(aq), HNO3(aq), H2SO4(aq), and \\nHClO4(aq) are strong electrolytes.

For \\nexample, the concentration of the 8.84 M HBr(aq) solution may be expressed \\nas either\\n\\n= 1 or\\n8.84 mol HBr\\n—\\n\\n1 L\\n= 1\\n\\n1 L\\n—\\n8.84 mol HBr\\n\\nMaking use of the second expression above, the volume of the solution is \\ngiven by\\n\\nvolume of solution = (0.166 mol HBr) = 18.8 mL\\n1 L\\n\\n—\\n8.84 mol HBr� �\\n\\n1000 mL\\n—\\n\\n1 L� �\\nWe could have also determined the volume required by solving Equation \\n\\n12.3 for V to obtain\\n\\n= 0.0188 L = 18.8 mL=\\n0.166 mol\\n—\\n8.84 mol·L–1\\n\\nV =\\nn\\n—\\nM\\n\\nThe following Example illustrates a calculation involving a reaction between \\na solution and a solid.\\n\\n\\n\\neXAMPle 12-6: Zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid, HCl(aq) (Figure \\n12.9), according to the equation\\n\\nZn(s) + 2 HCl(aq) → ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)\\n\\nCalculate how many grams of zinc react with 50.0 mL of 6.00 M HCl(aq).\\n\\nSolution: The equation for the reaction indicates that one mole of Zn(s) \\nreacts with two moles of HCl(aq).

Molarity Can be used to Calculate Quantities in  \\nPrecipitation reactions\\n\\nThe calculations that we have done so far involve the reaction of a solid with a \\nsolution. We can do similar calculations for a reaction between two solutions. \\nWe saw in Section 10-9 that precipitate formation is often the driving force in \\ndouble-replacement reactions. For example, when solutions of Hg2(NO3)2(aq) \\nand KI(aq) are mixed, a yellow precipitate of Hg2I2(s) is formed (Figure 12.11). \\nThe equation that describes this reaction is\\n\\nHg2(NO3)2(aq) + 2 KI(aq) → 2 KNO3(aq) + Hg2I2(s)\\n\\nand the net ionic equation is\\n\\nHg22+(aq) + 2 I–(aq) → Hg2I2(s)\\n\\n12-5.

The Concentration of an Acid or a base Can be  \\ndetermined by Titration\\n\\nWe showed in Chapter 10 that a double-replacement reaction may be driven by \\nthe formation of a covalent compound from ionic reactants. The most impor-\\ntant example is a neutralization reaction between an acid and a base.\\n\\nSuppose we have a basic solution whose concentration is not known. We \\nmeasure out a certain volume and then slowly add an acidic solution of known \\nconcentration until the base is completely neutralized. (We shall learn in Chap-\\nter 21 that the point at which a neutralization reaction is just completed can be \\nsignaled by substances called indicators that change colors when acids or bases \\n\\nfigure 12.13 When colorless solutions \\nof cadmium(II) nitrate, Cd(NO3)2(aq), \\nand sodium sulfide, Na2S(aq), are \\nmixed, a yellow-orange precipitate \\nforms.\\n\\n\\n\\nare neutralized.) Such a process is called a titration and can be carried out with \\nthe apparatus shown in Figure 12.14. Knowledge of the volume and concentra-\\ntion of the acidic solution that is required to neutralize the base and the reac-\\ntion stoichiometry are sufficient to determine the concentration of the basic \\nsolution. As an example, suppose we find that it requires 27.25 mL of 0.150 M \\nHCl(aq) solution to neutralize 30.00 mL of a NaOH(aq) solution. The chemical \\nequation that describes the reaction between HCl(aq) and NaOH(aq) is\\n\\nHCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)\\n\\nand the net ionic equation is\\n\\nH+(aq) + OH–(aq) → H2O(l)\\n\\nThis equation indicates that one mole of HCl(aq) is required to neutralize \\none mole of NaOH(aq). Therefore, the number of moles of NaOH(aq) that are \\nneutralized by the HCl(aq) in the titration is given by\\n\\n moles of NaOH = (27.25 mL HCl)\\n\\n= 4.09 × 10–3 mol\\n\\n1 L\\n—\\n1000 mL� �\\n\\n0.150 mol HCl\\n—\\n\\n1 L� �\\n1 mol NaOH\\n—\\n\\n1 mol HCl� �\\n\\nThere are, therefore, 4.09 × 10–3 moles of NaOH(aq) in the 30.00 mL of the \\nNaOH(aq) solution, so the concentration of NaOH(aq) in the solution is given \\nby\\n\\n= 0.136 M=\\n4.09 × 10–3 mol\\n—\\n30.00 × 10–3 L\\n\\nM =\\nn\\n—\\nV\\n\\nYou may have noticed in many of the calculations that we have done in this \\nchapter that a factor of one liter per 1000 mL, or 10–3 L·mL–1, occurs through-\\nout the calculations. This factor arises because the volumes in chemical experi-\\nments are usually expressed in milliliters; so when we use the equation n = MV \\nto calculate the number of moles, the stated volume in milliliters must be mul-\\ntiplied by 10–3 L·mL–1 to convert milliliters to liters. We can avoid these factors \\nof 10–3 L·mL–1 by using units of millimoles (mmol) instead of moles and thus \\nexpressing our concentrations as millimoles per milliliter rather than as moles \\nper liter.

Avogadro was a brilliant student, graduating with an \\nadvanced degree in ecclesiastical law at the age of 20. He practiced law for a few years, but then \\ndecided to teach physics and mathematics at a high school in Verceli, where his family owned \\nproperty. In 1820 he became professor of physics at the University of Turin. Shortly after, his \\nparticipation in a failed plot against the king of Sardinia caused him to lose his teaching post. \\nEventually, the political climate changed and in 1833 he was able to return to the university \\nwhere he taught for another 20 years. It was in 1811 when he was teaching high school in Verceli \\nthat he published what we now call “Avogadro’s hypothesis” that says that equal volumes of gases \\nat the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules. Unfortunately, \\nother chemists at that time had no appreciation of the difference between atoms and molecules, \\nand could not accept the possibility that elements such as nitrogen and oxygen could consist of \\ndiatomic molecules. Avogadro’s work was largely ignored for almost 50 years, until Cannizzaro \\nconvincingly showed that it leads to a consistent set of atomic masses.\\n\\nStanislao Cannizzaro, right, (1826–1910) was born in Palermo, Sicily. He enrolled as a medical \\nstudent at his local university at the age of 15, but soon turned to chemistry. After a few years \\nhe went on to the University of Pisa. His native Sicily was in open rebellion against the current \\ngovernment, and he returned to serve as an artillery officer with the insurgents. When the \\nrebellion was crushed a few years later, he escaped to Paris, where he carried out important \\nresearch in organic chemistry. Upon receiving his doctorate in chemistry, he held professorships \\nat a number of universities, and in 1861 accepted a chair of chemistry at Palermo. He spent 10 \\nyears there, after which he became chair of chemistry at the University of Rome, where he stayed \\nuntil one year before his death in 1910. Cannizzaro’s greatest contribution to chemistry was an \\n1858 memoir in which he used Avogadro’s hypothesis to deduce a consistent set of atomic and \\nmolecular masses. Prior to this, the state of atomic and molecular masses was in total confusion. \\nFor example, because of the lack of a consistent set of atomic masses, there were 18 different \\nformulas for acetic acid in use! This situation came to a head in 1860 when over one hundred \\nof the most prominent chemists of the world convened a conference at Karlsrule, Germany, to \\ndiscuss the muddled state of atomic masses. After many heated exchanges, Cannizzaro won over \\nthe majority of the participants, and shortly afterward chemistry had the first accurate version of \\nthe table of atomic masses that we use today. Many people consider this work of Cannizzaro to \\nbe one of the greatest contributions to chemistry.\\n\\n\\n\\n421\\n\\n13. Properties of Gases\\n\\nIn this chapter, we examine the properties of gases. Many chemical reactions involve gases as reactants or products or both, so we must determine how the \\nproperties of gases depend on conditions such as temperature, pressure, vol-\\nume, and number of moles. We show how gases respond to changes in pressure \\nand temperature and then discuss how the pressure, temperature, and volume \\nof a gas are related to one another. After presenting a number of experimental \\nobservations concerning gases, we discuss the kinetic theory of gases, which \\ngives us insight into the molecular nature of the gaseous state.\\n\\n13-1.  Most of the Volume of a Gas Is Empty Space\\n\\nBefore we discuss the nature of gases, we must first consider the three physical \\nstates of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Recall from Section 2-2 that a solid has \\na fixed volume and shape; a liquid has a fixed volume but assumes the shape \\nof the container into which it is poured; and a gas has neither a fixed volume \\nnor a fixed shape, but rather expands to occupy the entire volume of any closed \\ncontainer into which it is placed. We shall examine each of these states of mat-\\nter in more detail here.\\n\\nThe molecular picture of a crystalline solid is that of an ordered array, called \\na lattice, of particles (atoms, molecules, or ions), as shown in Figure 13.1.

PRoPERtIES oF GASES422\\n\\nindividual particles vibrate just a little around fixed lattice positions but are not \\nfree to move about (Figure 13.2a). The restrictions on the motion of the particles \\nof a solid are reflected by the fixed volume and shape that characterize a solid.\\n\\nA molecular view of a liquid (Figure 13.1) shows the particles in continuous \\ncontact with one another but free to move about throughout the liquid. There is \\nno orderly, fixed arrangement of particles in a liquid as there is in a solid. When \\na solid melts and becomes a liquid, the lattice breaks down and the constituent \\nparticles are no longer held in fixed positions (Figure 13.2b). The fact that the \\ndensities of the solid phase and the liquid phase of any substance do not differ \\ngreatly from each other indicates that the distance between particles is similar \\nin the two phases. Furthermore, the solid and liquid phases of a substance have \\nsimilar, small compressibilities, meaning that their volumes do not change ap-\\npreciably with increasing pressure. The similar compressibilities of the solid \\nand liquid phases of a substance are further evidence that the particles in the \\ntwo phases have similar separations.\\n\\nWhen a given mass of liquid is vaporized (converted to a gas), there is a \\nhuge increase in its volume. For example, one mole of liquid water occupies 17.3 \\nmL at 100°C, whereas one mole of water vapor occupies over 30 000 mL under \\nsimilar conditions. Upon vaporization, the molecules of a substance become \\nwidely separated, as indicated in Figure 13.1. The picture of a gas as a substance \\nwith widely separated particles accounts nicely for the relative ease with which \\ngases can be compressed. The particles take up only a small fraction of the total \\nspace occupied by a gas; most of the volume of a gas is empty space. As we note \\nlater in this chapter, the volume of a gas decreases markedly as the pressure \\nincreases; in other words, gases have large compressibilities.\\n\\n13-2.  A Manometer Can Be Used to Measure the Pressure of a Gas\\n\\nThe molecules of a gas are in constant motion, traveling about at high speeds \\nand colliding with one another and with the walls of the container. It is the \\nforce of these incessant, numerous collisions with the walls of the container that \\nis responsible for the pressure exerted by a gas.\\n\\nA common laboratory setup used to measure the pressure exerted by a gas \\nis a manometer, which is a glass U-shaped tube partially filled with a liquid \\n(Figure 13.3). Mercury is commonly used as the liquid in a manometer because \\nit has a high density and is fairly unreactive. Figure 13.3 illustrates the measure-\\n\\nFigure 13.2  Computer-calculated paths \\nof particles.

In Figure 13.3b the right-hand side \\nof the tube contains a vacuum so that the height h of the column of mercury \\nsupported by the gas in the flask is directly proportional to the pressure of the \\ngas. Because of this direct proportionality, it is convenient to express pressure \\nin terms of the height of a column of mercury that the gas will support. This \\nheight is usually measured in millimeters, so pressure is expressed in terms of \\nmillimeters of mercury (mm Hg). The pressure unit mm Hg is called a torr, af-\\nter the Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli. Torricelli invented the barometer, \\nwhich is used to measure atmospheric pressure (Figure 13.4). Thus, we say, for \\nexample, that the pressure of a gas is 600 Torr.\\n\\nAlthough mercury is most often used as the liquid in a manometer, other \\nliquids can be used. The height of the column of liquid that can be supported \\nby a gas is inversely proportional to the density of the liquid; that is, the less \\ndense the liquid, the taller the column will be.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 13-1: Calculate the height of a column of water that will be \\nsupported by a pressure of 755 Torr. Take the density of mercury to be  \\n13.6 g·mL–1 and that of water to be 1.00 g·mL–1.\\n\\nSolution: A pressure of 755 Torr corresponds to a column of mercury that is \\n755 mm high. Because mercury is 13.6 times more dense than water, the col-\\numn of water supported will be 13.6 times higher than that of mercury, or\\n\\nheight of water column = 13.6 × height of mercury column\\n = (13.6)(755 mm) = 1.03 × 104 mm \\n = 10.3 m (or 33.9 ft)\\n\\nFor a liquid to be useful as a manometric fluid, typical heights supported \\nmust be large enough to be accurately measured, but small enough to avoid \\nthe necessity for holes in the ceiling.

The manometer pictured in Figure 13.3 \\ncan be used to demonstrate this pressure. If the flask is open to the atmo-\\nsphere and the air in the right-hand side is evacuated, a column of mercury \\nwill be supported by the atmospheric (barometric) pressure. The height of \\nthe mercury column depends on elevation above sea level, temperature, and \\nclimatic conditions, but at sea level on a clear day it is about 760 mm as shown \\nin Figure 13.4.\\n\\nSeveral units are used to express pressure. One standard atmosphere (atm) \\nis defined as a pressure of 760 Torr. Although not an SI unit, it is still common \\nto express pressure in terms of atmospheres. Strictly speaking, torr and atmo-\\nsphere are not units of pressure but rather are quantities that are directly pro-\\nportional to pressure. Pressure is defined as a force per unit area:\\n\\nP =\\nF\\n—\\nA  \\n\\n(13.1)\\n\\nThe SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa), which is defined as one newton \\nper square meter. (A newton is the SI unit of force: 1 N = 1 kg·m·s–2. A newton \\nis roughly equal to the gravitational force exerted on an apple at the earth’s \\nsurface.)

Boyle was able \\nto show that, at constant temperature, the volume of a given sample of gas is \\ninversely proportional to the pressure:\\n\\nV ∝ 1—\\nP  \\n\\n  \\n\\nWe can also write this relationship as\\n\\n \\nV = (constant temperature)\\n\\nc\\n—\\nP\\n\\n  (13.3) \\n\\nwhere c denotes a proportionality constant whose value in each case is deter-\\nmined by the amount and the temperature of the gas. The relationship between \\npressure and volume expressed in Equation 13.3 is known as Boyle’s law. Equa-\\ntion 13.3 is plotted in Figure 13.8. Note that the greater the pressure on a gas, \\nthe smaller is the volume at constant temperature. If we double the pressure on \\na gas, then its volume decreases by a factor of two.\\n\\nOur molecular picture of a gas provides us with a nice interpretation of \\nBoyle’s law. The pressure that a gas exerts on the walls of its container is due \\nto the incessant collisions of the molecules with the walls. If we decrease the \\nvolume, then the molecules collide more frequently with the walls, and hence \\n\\nFigure 13.7  Robert Boyle (1627–1691) \\nwas born in Ireland. His father, the first \\nEarl of Cork, was one of the wealthiest \\nmen in Britain. Boyle was educated at \\nEton, but finished his education under \\na private tutor. His father sent him \\non a tour of Europe to complete his \\neducation, where he learned French, \\nLatin, Italian, rhetoric, theology, and \\nmathematics. After his father’s death, \\nhe moved to his father’s manor in \\nStalbridge, England, setting up a \\nlaboratory there. Boyle took regular \\ntrips to London to discuss science at \\ngatherings of “The Invisible College.” \\nThis informal meeting of scientists later \\nbecome the Royal Society of London, \\nthe oldest continuous scientific society \\nin the world. Boyle’s goal was to apply \\nmathematical analysis to chemistry, \\nbelieving that “nature was a complex \\nsystem governed by a small number of \\nmathematical laws.” In his most famous \\nexperiments, he demonstrated the \\nrelationship between the pressure and \\nthe volume of a gas—known today as \\nBoyle’s law.\\n\\nV\\n\\nP\\n\\n0\\n0\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n09/10/09\\n\\n013-008\\n\\nx\\n\\nFigure 13.8  Boyle’s law states that \\nthe volume of a gas at constant \\ntemperature is inversely proportional \\nto its pressure.\\n\\n\\n\\n42713-4. thE VoLUME oF GAS IS RELAtEd to ItS PRESSURE And tEMPERAtURE\\n\\nexert a larger pressure (Figure 13.9).

This relationship is known as Charles’s law. Charles’s \\nlaw also has a nice interpretation in terms of our molecular picture of a gas. We \\nshall see in Section 13-10 that the speeds of the molecules increase with increas-\\ning temperature. Therefore, as the temperature of the gas increases, the speeds \\nof the molecules increase and the collisions with the walls are more energetic, \\nand so exert a higher pressure. If the container is not rigid, this in turn leads to \\na larger volume of the gas. Thus, we see that an increase in temperature leads \\nto an increase in volume, in accord with Charles’s law.\\n\\nTypical experimental data illustrating Charles’s law are plotted in Figure \\n13.11. Notice in Figure 13.11 that all three sets of experimental data extrapolate \\nto the same point. Careful experimental measurements show that this point cor-\\nresponds to a temperature of –273.15°C. The lines in Figure 13.11 suggest that if \\nwe add 273.15 to the temperatures expressed on the Celsius scale, then all three \\nof the lines in Figure 13.11 will meet at the origin, as shown in Figure 13.12. This \\nnew temperature scale that we have proposed—adding 273.15 to the Celsius \\ntemperatures—turns out to be a fundamental temperature scale.

The balloon (pictured here) \\ncovered 43 kilometers before landing. \\nCharles brought onboard a barometer \\nand thermometer, making this both the \\nfirst manned hydrogen balloon flight \\nand the first scientific flight.\\n\\n\\n\\n13.

All three curves intersect at the \\norigin (compare with Figure 13.11).\\n\\nWe have expressed Equation 13.4 \\nin Guggenheim notation, which we \\ndiscussed in Section 1-10.\\n\\nwho first proposed it. The unit of this temperature scale is the kelvin (denoted \\nby K), which we introduced in Chapter 1 when we discussed SI units. Using T\\nto denote a Kelvin temperature and t to denote a Celsius temperature, we can \\nexpress the relation between the two temperature scales as\\n\\nT/K = t/°C + 273.15 (13.4)\\n\\nWe call the units of T “kelvins,” not “degrees kelvin.” The Kelvin temperature \\nscale is fundamental because zero kelvin is the lowest possible temperature. We \\nrefer to 0 K as absolute zero. By setting T = 0 K in Equation 13.4, we see that \\nthe lowest temperature on the Celsius scale is –273.15°C. Figure 1.10 compares \\nthe temperature values of a number of fixed points on the various temperature \\nscales.\\n\\nThe Kelvin temperature scale allows us to deduce a simple mathematical re-\\nlation between volume and temperature. Recall from algebra that the equation \\nof a straight line may be expressed as\\n\\ny = mx + b (13.5)\\n\\nwhere m and b are constants. The quantity b is the intercept of the straight line \\nwith the y axis (the vertical axis), and m is the slope of the line and is a mea-\\nsure of the line’s steepness (see Appendix A). All three curves in Figure 13.12 \\nintercept the vertical axis at the origin, so the value of the intercept (b) is zero. \\nReplacing y by V and x by T in Equation 13.5, we have\\n\\n V = mT         (constant pressure) (13.6)\\n\\nwhich is the algebraic equation for the lines plotted in Figure 13.12. The value \\nof the slope (m) depends on the pressure and the amount of gas.\\n\\n\\n\\n42913.4 thE VoLUME oF GAS IS RELAtEd to ItS PRESSURE And tEMPERAtURE\\n\\nEquation 13.6 says that the volume of a fixed quantity of a gas at a fixed pres-\\nsure is directly proportional to the Kelvin temperature of the gas. Equation 13.6 \\nis an expression of Charles’s law, and we can use it to calculate how the volume \\nof a gas changes if we change its temperature, keeping the amount of gas and its \\npressure fixed. Suppose that a sample of helium gas in a flexible container such \\nas a balloon (Figure 13.13) occupies a volume of 1.25 liters at 10.0°C and that \\nwe cool the helium by placing it in liquid nitrogen at –196°C.

EqUAL VoLUMES oF GASES At thE SAME PRESSURE And tEMPERAtURE\\n\\n13-5.  Equal Volumes of Gases at the Same Pressure and \\ntemperature Contain Equal numbers of Molecules\\n\\nEarly experiments led to the discovery of a remarkable property of gaseous re-\\nactions. It was observed by the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (Figure \\n13.15) in the early 1800s that if all volumes are measured at the same pressure \\nand temperature, then the volumes in which gases combine in chemical reac-\\ntions are related to each other by small whole numbers. For example,\\n\\nIn each of these cases the relative volumes of reactants and products are in \\nthe proportion of simple whole numbers. This observation is known as Gay-\\nLussac’s law of combining volumes and was one of the earliest indications of \\nthe existence of atoms and molecules. The interpretation of Gay-Lussac’s law by \\nthe Italian chemist Amedeo Avogadro (Frontispiece) in 1811 led to the realiza-\\ntion that many of the common gaseous elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, \\nnitrogen, and chlorine, occur naturally as diatomic molecules (H2, O2, N2, and \\nCl2) rather than as single atoms. This was such an important result in the devel-\\nopment of chemistry that we shall review Avogadro’s line of reasoning to arrive \\nat his conclusion.\\n\\nFollowing Gay-Lussac’s observations, Avogadro postulated that equal vol-\\numes of gases at the same pressure and temperature contain equal numbers of \\n\\nhydrogen gas oxygen gas gaseous vapor\\n\\nhydrogen gas chlorine gas hydrogen chloride gas\\n\\nhydrogen gas nitrogen gas ammonia gas\\n\\n1 volume2 volumes 2 volumes\\n\\n1 volume1 volume 2 volumes\\n\\n1 volume3 volumes 2 volumes\\n\\n(b)\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(c)\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n+\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n09/11/09\\n\\n013-in text\\n\\nx\\n\\n\\n\\n13.

Consider the reaction between hydrogen and chlo-\\nrine to form hydrogen chloride. Experimentally, it is observed that one volume of \\nhydrogen reacts with one volume of chlorine to produce two volumes of hydrogen \\nchloride. According to Avogadro’s reasoning, this means that one molecule of hy-\\ndrogen reacts with one molecule of chlorine to produce two molecules of hydrogen \\nchloride (Figure 13.16). If one molecule of hydrogen can form two molecules \\nof hydrogen chloride, then a hydrogen molecule must consist of two atoms (at \\nleast) of hydrogen. Avogadro pictured both hydrogen and chlorine as diatomic \\ngases and was able to represent the reaction between them as\\n\\nH2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2 HCl(g)\\n1 molecule + 1 molecule → 2 molecules\\n\\n 1 volume + 1 volume → 2 volumes\\n\\nPrior to Avogadro’s explanation, it was difficult to see how one volume of hy-\\ndrogen could produce two volumes of hydrogen chloride. If hydrogen occurred \\nsimply as atoms, there would be no way to explain Gay-Lussac’s law of combin-\\ning volumes. Another example of Avogadro’s law is illustrated by\\n\\n 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g)\\n2 molecules + 1 molecule → 2 molecules\\n\\n 2 volumes + 1 volume → 2 volumes\\n\\nThe work of Gay-Lussac and Avogadro’s subsequent interpretation repre-\\nsent a great turning point in the history of chemistry—allowing chemists to \\nquantitatively discuss chemical reactions in the unifying language of atoms \\nand molecules. In spite of the beautiful simplicity of Avogadro’s explanation of \\nthese reactions, his work was largely ignored and chemists continued to confuse \\natoms and molecules and to use many incorrect chemical formulas for quite \\nsome time. It was not until the mid-1800s, after Avogadro’s death, that his hy-\\npothesis was finally appreciated and generally accepted (Frontispiece).\\n\\n13-6.  the Ideal-Gas Equation Is a Combination of Boyle’s,  \\nCharles’s, and Avogadro’s Laws\\n\\nAvogadro postulated that equal volumes of gases at the same pressure and tem-\\nperature contain the same number of molecules. This statement implies that \\nequal volumes of gases at the same pressure and temperature contain equal \\nnumbers of moles, n. Thus, we can write Avogadro’s law as\\n\\nV ∝ n    (fixed P and T)\\n\\nBoyle’s law and Charles’s law are, respectively,\\n\\nV ∝ (fixed T and n)1—\\nP\\n\\nV ∝ T (fixed P and n)\\n\\n   \\n(fixed T and n)\\n\\nV ∝ T          (fixed P and n)\\n\\nFigure 13.15  The French scientist \\nJoseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778–\\n1850). Gay-Lussac performed \\ndetailed quantitative experiments \\non gases. He is best known for \\nhis law of combining volumes \\nin which he demonstrated that \\nduring reactions, gas volumes \\ncombine in simple whole-number \\nratios. Gay-Lussac independently \\ndiscovered Charles’s law and, like \\nCharles, made several ascents in \\nhydrogen balloons to collect data \\non the atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n\\n43313-6. thE IdEAL-GAS EqUAtIon IS A CoMBInAtIon oF LAWS\\n\\nWe can combine these three proportionality statements for volume, V, into one \\nby writing\\n\\nV ∝ nT—\\nP\\n\\nNote how the three individual statements for V are all included in the com-\\nbined statement. For example, if P and n are fixed, then only T can vary; and we \\nsee that V ~ T, which is Charles’s law. If P and T are fixed, then only n can vary; \\nand we have Avogadro’s law, V ~ n. Finally, if T and n are fixed, then we have \\nBoyle’s law, V ~ 1/P.\\n\\nWe can convert the combined proportionality statement for V to an equa-\\ntion by introducing a proportionality constant, R, and writing the equation as\\n\\n PV = nRT (13.8)\\n\\nThis expression is called the ideal-gas law or ideal-gas equation. It is based on \\nBoyle’s law, Charles’s law, and Avogadro’s law. Boyle’s law and Charles’s law are \\nvalid only at low pressures (less than a few bars or atmospheres, say), so Equa-\\ntion 13.8 is likewise valid only at low pressures. It turns out, however, that most \\ngases do not deviate from Equation 13.8 by more than a few percent at pressures \\nup to tens of bars or atmospheres, so Equation 13.8 is quite useful.

PRoPERtIES oF GASES434\\n\\nThe ideal-gas equation is an example of what we call an equation of state. \\nThe state of a gas is specified by its pressure, volume, temperature, and number \\nof moles; an equation that relates these to one another is called an equation of \\nstate. The ideal-gas equation, which is accurate only for low pressures and high \\ntemperatures, is the simplest equation of state. In the final section of this chap-\\nter, we shall introduce an equation of state that extends the ideal-gas equation \\nto higher pressures and lower temperatures.\\n\\nBefore we can use Equation 13.8, we must determine the value of R, the \\nmolar gas constant. It has been determined experimentally that one mole of \\nan ideal gas at 0°C and one atm occupies 0.0224141 m3 or 22.4141 liters. This \\nvolume, shown in Figure 13.17, is the molar volume of an ideal gas at 0°C and \\none atm.\\n\\nIf we solve Equation 13.8 for R  and substitute this information into the re-\\nsulting equation using SI units, we find that\\n\\n \\n\\nR = =\\n\\n= 8.3145 Pa·m3· mol–1·K–1 = 8.3145 J·mol–1·K–1\\n\\nPV\\n—\\nnT\\n\\n(1 atm) (0.0224141 m3)\\n1.01325 × 105 Pa\\n—\\n\\n1 atm\\n—\\n\\n(1 mol)(273.15 K)\\n\\n� �\\n\\n (13.9)\\n\\nwhere we have made use of Equation 13.2 (1 Pa = 1 J·m–3) to convert from Pa·m3 \\nto joules and the fact that one atm is 1.01325 × 105 Pa (Table 13.1).\\n\\nAs we have seen, when working with SI units, P  is expressed in units of \\npascals (Pa), V  in cubic meters (m3), n  in moles, and T  in kelvins. In contrast, \\nwhen working with liters and atmospheres, P  must be expressed in standard \\natmospheres, V  in liters, n  in moles, and T  in kelvins.

It is because of this that Avogadro’s \\nlaw is valid. That is, equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pres-\\nsure, contain equal numbers of molecules (or moles) because n = PV/RT  for \\nany  gas that obeys this relationship. In contrast, the density of a gas depends \\non its molar mass, Equation 13.12.

For example, air is a mixture of \\nabout 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% argon by volume with lesser amounts \\nof other gases, such as carbon dioxide. Many chemical processes involve gas-\\neous mixtures (Figure 13.19). For example, the commercial production of am-\\nmonia involves the reaction described by the equation\\n\\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ 2 NH3(g)3 H2(g) + N2(g)\\n300 bar\\n\\n500°C\\n\\nThus, the reaction vessel contains a mixture of N2(g), H2(g), and NH3(g).\\nIn a mixture of ideal gases, each gas exerts a pressure as if it were present \\n\\nalone in the container. For a mixture of two ideal gases, we have\\n\\n Ptotal = P1 + P2  (13.14)\\n\\nThe pressure exerted by each gas is called its partial pressure, and Equation \\n13.14 is known as Dalton’s law of partial pressures.

Notice that a mole fraction is unitless (it is a fraction) and that\\n\\n x1 + x2 = 1 (13.19)\\n\\nEquation 13.17 can be written in terms of mole fractions as\\n\\nP1 = x1Ptotal            P2 = x2Ptotal (13.20)\\n\\nwhich expresses the partial pressure of each species in terms of its mole fraction \\nand the total pressure.\\n\\nIf we multiply both the numerators and the denominators in Equations 13.18 \\nby Avogadro’s number, then x1 and x2 will be expressed as molecular fractions,\\n\\n \\nx1 =\\n\\nN1—\\nNtotal\\n\\nx2 =\\nN2—\\n\\nNtotal \\n(13.21)\\n\\nwhere N1 and N2 are the number of molecules of gases 1 and 2, respectively. \\nThus, x1, for example, is the fraction of molecules in a mixture that are gas 1 \\nmolecules. With this in mind, we can give a simple molecular interpretation \\nof Dalton’s law of partial pressures. The pressure exerted by a gas or a gaseous \\nmixture is due to the constant collisions of the molecules of the gas with the \\nwalls of the container. According to the ideal-gas law, at a fixed temperature \\nand volume, the pressure exerted by a gas is proportional only to the number of \\nmolecules of the gas. Thus, in a mixture of gases, the partial pressure of each \\ngas is the total pressure multiplied by the fraction of molecules of each gas.\\n\\nEquations 13.14 through 13.21 may be expressed for a mixture of N  gases by \\na more general form of Equation 13.14, namely, Ptotal = P1 + P2 + . . . + PN, which \\nyields\\n\\nPi = = xiPtotal,\\nniRT—\\n\\nV\\nxi = x1 + x2 + … + xN  = 1 ,\\n\\nni—\\nntotal\\n\\nwhere i represents the ith species in the gas.\\n\\n\\n\\n44513-8. thE totAL PRESSURE oF A MIXtURE oF IdEAL GASES\\n\\nEXAMPLE 13-12: A 0.428-gram mixture of gases contained in a vessel at \\n1.75 atm is found to be 15.6% N2(g), 46.0% N2O(g), and 38.4% CO2(g) by \\nmass.

The atmospheric pressure is 729 Torr, and the vapor \\npressure of H2O(l) at 14°C is 12.0 Torr; therefore,\\n\\nPO2 = Ptotal – PH2O = (729 – 12.0) Torr = 717 Torr\\n\\nFrom this value, we calculate the number of moles of O2(g) produced using \\nthe ideal-gas equation:\\n\\nn = = 0.0100 mol=\\nPV\\n—\\nRT\\n\\n(717 Torr)(0.250 L)\\n—\\n(62.36 L·Torr·mol–1·K–1)(287 K)\\n\\nTo find the volume of O2(g) at 0°C and 760 Torr, we use the form of Equa-\\ntion 13.11 we derived earlier:\\n\\nVf  = Vi\\nTf—\\nTi� �\\n\\nPi—\\nPf� � = 0.224 L= (0.250 L)\\n\\n717 Torr\\n—\\n760 Torr� � 273 K—287 K� �\\n\\nThus, the molar volume of O2(g) at 0°C and 760 Torr is\\n\\nmolar volume of O2 = = 22.4 L·mol–1 \\n0.224 L\\n—\\n0.0100 mol\\n\\nFigure 13.21  (a) The collection of a gas over water.

As we \\nhave seen, the molecules in a gas are widely separated and in constant motion \\nand exert a pressure as they collide with the walls of the container. By applying \\nthe laws of physics to the motion of the molecules, it is possible to calculate the \\npressure exerted by the molecules as a result of their collisions with the walls of \\nthe container. Because this approach focuses on the motion of the molecules, it \\nis called the kinetic theory of gases.\\n\\nRecall from Chapter 1 that a body in motion has energy by virtue of the fact \\nthat it is in motion. The energy associated with the motion of a body, called \\nkinetic energy (Ek), is given by Equation 1.4 as\\n\\nEk = \\n1–\\n2mv\\n\\n2 \\n\\nwhere m  is the mass of the body and v  is its velocity (or speed). If m  is expressed \\nin kilograms and v in meters per second, then Ek has the units of joules (J). \\nRecall that 1 J = 1 kg·m2·s–2 (see Appendix B).\\n\\nWe shall see in Example 13-15 that the typical speed of a nitrogen molecule \\nat room temperature is about 500 m·s–1, or about 1100 miles per hour (mph). \\nLet’s calculate the kinetic energy of a mole of nitrogen molecules if each mol-\\necule has a speed of 500 m·s–1. The kinetic energy per mole of molecules, each \\ntraveling with a speed, v, is given by\\n\\n \\nEk = \\n\\n1–\\n2Mkgv\\n\\n2 \\n \\n\\n(13.23)\\n\\nwhere Mkg is the molar mass in kilograms per mole. The molar mass must be ex-\\npressed in units of kilograms per mole (kg·mol–1) so that the units of Ek will be \\njoules per mole ( J·mol–1 = kg·m2·s–2·mol–1). Thus, the kinetic energy per mole \\nof nitrogen molecules is given by\\n\\n(500 m·s–1)2\\n\\n= 3500 J·mol–1 = 3.5 kJ·mol–1\\n\\nEk = \\n1–\\n2(28.0 g·mol\\n\\n–1)\\n1 kg\\n—\\n1000 g� �\\n\\nif each nitrogen molecule has a speed of 500 m·s–1. Dividing by Avogadro’s num-\\nber, we see that the kinetic energy in joules per nitrogen molecule at room \\ntemperature is about 6 × 10–21 J, or about 0.006 aJ.\\n\\nAlthough, for simplicity, we have just implied that all the molecules in a \\ngas travel at the same speed; in fact, they do not.

Note that the curves are \\nsomewhat similar to those in Figure 13.23, in the sense that they rise through a \\nmaximum and then fall off to zero as v increases.\\n\\n13-10.  the Kinetic theory of Gases Allows Us to Calculate the \\nRoot-Mean-Square Speed of a Molecule\\n\\nWe are now ready to discuss the kinetic theory of gases. The postulates of the \\nkinetic theory of gases are as follows:\\n\\n1.  The molecules in a gas are incessantly in motion. They collide randomly \\nwith one another and with the walls of the container.\\n\\n2.  All collisions between the gas particles or the walls of the chamber are \\nelastic. That is, no energy is lost due to heat or friction during collisions.\\n\\nFigure 13.25  James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879), born in \\nEdinburgh, Scotland, made significant contributions to many \\nfields of science. He and Boltzmann applied the methods of \\nprobability to describe the motions of molecules in gases and \\nshowed that their velocities follow the Maxwell-Boltzmann \\ndistribution. His greatest work was his theory of electricity and \\nmagnetism, that is summarized by four equations called Maxwell’s \\nequations, known by all students of physics. Using these equations, \\nhe calculated that the speed of propagation of an electromagnetic \\nwave is the same as the speed of light, thus showing that light is a \\nform of electromagnetic radiation. In 1871, he became the first \\nCavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge University, now one \\nof the most prestigious chairs in all of science.\\n\\nFigure 13.26  Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906), born \\nin Vienna, Austria, received his doctorate from the \\nUniversity of Vienna, where he did experimental work \\non gases and radiation. He became known for his \\ntheoretical work on thermodynamics and the kinetic \\ntheory of gases. He was an early proponent of atomic \\ntheory, and his work involved a study of the atomic \\ntheory of matter. The distribution of the speeds and the \\nenergies of gas molecules is now called the Maxwell-\\nBoltzmann distribution. At the time, the atomic nature \\nof matter was not generally accepted and Boltzmann’s \\nwork was criticized by a number of eminent scientists.\\n\\n\\n\\n45113-10. thE KInEtIC thEoRY oF GASES\\n\\n 3.  The average distance between the molecules in a gas is much larger than \\nthe size of the molecules. In other words, the gas consists mostly of empty \\nspace.\\n\\n 4.  Any interactions between the molecules in a gas are negligible. We assume \\nthat the molecules in a gas neither repel nor attract one another.\\n\\n 5.  The mean (or average) kinetic energy of the molecules in a gas is propor-\\ntional to the Kelvin temperature of the gas.\\n\\nThis last postulate involves the mean kinetic energy because there is a dis-\\ntribution of molecular kinetic energies. It is common notation to denote the \\nmean of a quantity by placing a bar over the symbol for that quantity, so, using \\nEquation 13.23, we can write the mean kinetic energy per mole as\\n\\n \\nEk = \\n\\n1–\\n2Mkgv\\n\\n2 \\n \\n\\n(13.24)\\n\\nOur fifth postulate of the kinetic theory of gases states that\\n\\n \\nEk = \\n\\n1–\\n2Mkgv\\n\\n2 = cT \\n \\n\\n(13.25)\\n\\nwhere c is a proportionality constant.\\nThe first four postulates of the kinetic theory of gases describe the model of \\n\\na gas that we have already introduced, and we shall see the importance of the \\nfinal postulate shortly. From these postulates, we can calculate the properties of \\ngases in terms of molecular quantities. For example, we can calculate an expres-\\nsion for the pressure of a gas in terms of the speeds of its constituent molecules. \\nA detailed analysis of the collisions between molecules in a gas shows that the \\nproportionality constant in Equation 13.25 is c = 3R/2, where R  is the molar gas \\nconstant. Therefore, Equation 13.25 becomes\\n\\n \\nEk = \\n\\n3–\\n2RT \\n\\n \\n(13.26)\\n\\nEquation 13.26 states that the temperature of an ideal gas is directly related \\nto its mean kinetic energy, which is the idea behind the fifth postulate of the \\nkinetic theory of gases. It tells us the meaning of temperature, an observed quan-\\ntity, in terms of the mean value of a molecular property, the kinetic energy of the \\ngas molecules.\\n\\nBecause Ek = \\n1–\\n2Mkgv\\n\\n2  is expressed in units of joule?mole–1, we must express R in units \\nof joule·mole–1·kelvin–1 when we use Equation 13.26. Thus, we use the value \\nR = 8.3145 J·mol–1·K–1 when calculating the mean kinetic energy of gases. We \\ncan use Equations 13.25 and 13.26 to calculate an important measure of the \\nspeed at which the molecules in a gas travel. Equating these two expressions for \\nmean kinetic energy yields\\n\\n \\n1–\\n2Mkgv\\n\\n2 = 3–2RT  \\n(13.27)\\n\\nWe first solve Equation 13.27 for the mean value of v2,\\n\\nv2 =\\n3RT\\n—\\nMkg\\n\\n\\n\\n13.

We all have observed that it may take several minutes for an odor \\nto spread through a draft-free room. The explanation for this observation lies \\nin the fact that the molecules in a gas undergo many collisions, so their actual \\npath is a chaotic, zigzag path like that shown in Figure 13.29. Between colli-\\nsions, gas molecules travel with speeds of hundreds of meters per second, but \\ntheir net progress is quite slow. The average distance traveled between collisions \\nis called the mean free path (l).\\n\\nWe can estimate the mean free path by reasoning that the greater the \\ndensity of molecules, the more often a molecule will collide; so the mean free \\npath will be shorter. Therefore, the mean free path should be inversely pro-\\nportional to the number density of molecules, N/V , where N  is the number of \\nmolecules in a given volume, V . Furthermore, the greater the cross-sectional \\narea of a molecule, the greater a target it will present for other molecules; and \\nagain the mean free path will be shorter. If a molecule has a diameter equal to \\nd, then its cross-sectional area will be approximately πr2 (the area of a circle) \\nor π(d/2)2. Therefore, the mean free path should be inversely proportional to \\nthe square of the diameter of the molecule.

As the \\npressure on a given quantity of gas is increased, however, deviations from the \\nideal-gas equation appear. These deviations can be displayed graphically by \\nplotting PV/RT  as a function of pressure, as shown in Figure 13.30. For one \\nmole of an ideal gas, PV/RT  is equal to unity for any value of P, so deviations \\nfrom ideal-gas behavior occur as deviations of the ratio PV/RT  from unity. The \\nextent of deviation from ideality at a given pressure depends on the tempera-\\nture and the nature of the gas. The closer the gas is to the point at which it \\nliquefies, the larger the deviation from ideal behavior will be. There are many \\nequations that correct the ideal-gas law for these deviations from ideality. We \\nshall examine the simplest and most famous of them here.\\n\\nThe ideal-gas equation is based upon the physical assumptions that (1) the \\nsizes of the molecules of the gas are essentially zero and (2) that they do not \\nattract each other. Both of these assumptions are incorrect: molecules do have \\na certain size and they do attract each other. We can modify the ideal-gas equa-\\ntion to take these two factors into account. We’ll first subtract the actual volume \\nof the molecules of the gas from V to write V – nb, where b is a constant whose \\nvalue depends upon the gas and is a measure of the size of the molecules. The \\nquantity V – nb can be interpreted as the actual volume that is free for the mol-\\necules to move about in (Figure 13.31). Substituting V – nb  for V  in the ideal-gas \\nequation gives us\\n\\n P(V – nb) = nRT  (13.36)\\n\\nP\\nV\\n\\n/R\\nT\\n\\nP /bar\\n\\n2.00\\n\\n1.50\\n\\n1.00\\n\\n0.50\\n\\n0.00\\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\\n\\nIdeal gas\\n\\nN2\\n\\nCH4\\n\\nH2\\n\\nHe\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n09/11/09\\n\\n013-031\\n\\nx\\n\\nFigure 13.30  A plot of (PV/RT) versus \\nP  for one mole of helium, hydrogen, \\nnitrogen, and methane at 300 K. \\nThis figure shows that the ideal-gas \\nequation, for which PV/RT = 1, is not \\nvalid at high pressures.\\n\\n\\n\\n13. PRoPERtIES oF GASES458\\n\\nThis equation recognizes the finite size of the molecules, but does not take into \\naccount the attraction between the molecules. Because of the attractive forces \\nbetween the molecules, the actual pressure of the gas is less than that given \\nby the ideal-gas law (Figure 13.32). Because the attraction is between pairs of \\nmolecules, this factor is proportional to the square of the density of the gas. If \\nwe let the proportionality constant be a, then we can write\\n\\n                                                 \\nPactual = Pideal – a\\n\\n2n\\n—\\nV� �  \\n\\n(13.37)\\n\\nSubstituting Pideal from Equation 13.37 for the pressure, P, given by the ideal-gas \\nlaw in Equation 13.36, we obtain\\n\\n \\nP + a (V – nb) = nRT\\n\\nn2\\n—\\nV 2� �  (13.38)\\n\\nEquation 13.38 is called the van der Waals equation, after the Dutch sci-\\nentist and Nobel laureate Johannes van der Waals (Figure 13.33), who was the \\nfirst to recognize the importance of molecular size and molecular attractions \\non the equation of state that describes a gas.

The pressure exerted by a gas is due to the inces-\\nsant collisions of the gas molecules on the walls of the container. At constant \\ntemperature, the volume and the pressure of a gas are related by Boyle’s law, \\nwhich says that volume and pressure are inversely related. The relation between \\nthe volume of a gas and its temperature is given by Charles’s law, which serves \\nalso to define the absolute or Kelvin temperature scale.\\n\\nThe experimental study of the combining volumes of reacting gases led to \\nGay-Lussac’s law of combining volumes. Gay-Lussac’s law in turn led to Avoga-\\ndro’s law, which states that equal volumes of gases at the same pressure and \\ntemperature contain equal numbers of molecules. Boyle’s, Charles’s, and Avo-\\ngadro’s laws can be combined into the ideal-gas law, which relates the pressure, \\nvolume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas.\\n\\nAll the experimental gas laws can be explained by the kinetic theory of \\ngases. One of the central tenets of the kinetic theory of gases is that the mean \\nkinetic energy of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. The \\nkinetic theory provides equations that can be used to calculate the root- mean-\\nsquare speed of a molecule, its mean free path, collision frequency, relative rate \\nof effusion, and other molecular quantities.\\n\\nThe ideal-gas equation is valid for all gases at sufficiently low densities and \\nsufficiently high temperatures. As the pressure on a given quantity of gas is \\nincreased, however, deviations from the ideal-gas equation are observed. The \\nvan der Waals equation, which takes into account that the molecules of a gas \\nattract one another and have a finite size, is valid at higher densities and lower \\ntemperatures than is the ideal-gas equation.\\n\\nFigure 13.33  Johannes Diderik van \\nder Waals (1837–1923) was born in \\nLeiden, the Netherlands. He did his \\ndoctoral thesis on the properties of \\ngases and, soon after, published what \\nis now known as the van der Waals \\nequation. In 1876 he became the first \\nprofessor of physics at the University of \\nAmsterdam, which under his influence \\nbecame a major center of theoretical \\nand experimental research on fluids. \\nVan der Waals received the 1910 Nobel \\nPrize in Physics for his work on the \\nequation of state for gases and liquids.\\n\\n\\n\\n13.

He and his elder brother were tutored at home by John Dalton, who \\nwas then in his 70s. Due to his father’s wealth, Joule never engaged in any profession \\nnor did he manage the family brewery. He conducted his pioneering experiments in \\nlaboratories that he built in his home or in his father’s brewery at his own expense. \\nFrom 1837 to 1847, he carried out a series of experiments that led to the general \\nlaw of the conservation of energy. Joule announced his measurements in a public \\nlecture at St. Ann’s Church in Manchester, England, because his earlier reports had \\nbeen rejected by the British Association. He later had his lecture published in the \\nManchester Courier, a newspaper for which his brother wrote musical critiques. In \\n1847, he presented his results to the British Association meeting in Oxford, where \\nthe importance of his work was finally appreciated. Due to his lack of mathematical \\ntraining, Joule did not contribute further to the new and expanding field of \\nthermodynamics. Joule was elected to the Royal Society in 1850. His wife died \\nyoung, leaving Joule to raise his two children by himself. Later in life he suffered \\nsevere financial losses, and in 1878 friends obtained a pension for him from the \\ngovernment. Unfortunately, his mental powers had begun to decline and he died \\nafter a long illness. The SI unit of energy is named in his honor.\\n\\n\\n\\n469\\n\\n14.

Thermochemistry \\nis the branch of thermodynamics that deals with the evolution or absorption \\nof energy as heat in chemical processes. Most chemical reactions are accom-\\npanied by the evolution or the absorption of energy as heat. Energy evolved \\nin the burning of petroleum, natural gas, and coal supplies over 85% of the \\nenergy used annually in the United States. All living organisms store energy in \\nthe form of certain chemicals. Rockets, missiles, and explosives all derive their \\npower from the energy released in chemical reactions (Figure 14.1). In this \\nchapter we develop an understanding of the energy changes involved in chemi-\\ncal reactions.\\n\\nFigure 14.1 Blastoff of a space shuttle. \\nThe energy released by the three main \\nengines is equivalent to the output of \\n23 Hoover Dams.

ThermochemisTry470\\n\\n14-1.  The Transfer of energy Between a reaction system and  \\nits surroundings occurs as Work or heat\\n\\nChemical reactions almost always involve a transfer of energy between the reac-\\ntion system and its surroundings. The reaction system includes all the chemi-\\ncals involved in the reaction. The surroundings consist of everything else, such \\nas containers, water baths, and the atmosphere.\\n\\nThere are two ways in which energy can be transferred between a reac-\\ntion system and its surroundings: either as work or as heat. Thermodynamics \\n(thermo = heat, dynamics = change) is the study of these energy transfers. The \\ntransfer of energy as work involves the action of a force through a distance. \\nSuppose our system consists of the contents of a gas inside a cylinder equipped \\nwith a piston at some initial height h, as shown in Figure 14.2. The applica-\\ntion of a constant force, F, to the piston causes a displacement of the system \\nby an amount Dh. Recall that the Greek letter delta, D, indicates a change in a \\nquantity. The value of Dh is determined by subtracting the initial value of the \\nquantity h from the final value. Thus, Dh = hfinal − hinitial. The work done on a sys-\\ntem is given by the magnitude of the force times the displacement (Dh) caused \\nby the force. Thus, we can express the work, w, done on the system by\\n\\n w = –FDh (14.1)\\n\\nThe minus sign occurs in Equation 14.1 because we shall use the convention \\nthat the work done on a system is a positive quantity. Observe that when the \\npiston in Figure 14.2 is pushed inward, Dh = hfinal − hinitial has a negative value \\nbecause hfinal < hinitial (compression). The minus sign in Equation 14.1 makes \\nthe right-hand side of the equation a positive value, as required for work done \\nupon compressing a system (the system being compressed gains energy from \\nthe surroundings). Conversely, the work done by the system during expansion \\nis a negative quantity because energy is lost by the system to the surroundings \\nwhen the system does work. This concept is easy to grasp if you remember that \\nwhen the work is positive the system gains energy, and when the work is negative the system \\nloses energy.\\n\\nWe learned in the previous chapter that pressure is defined as force per unit \\narea, or P = F/A, so that the force on the cylinder is given by F  = PA. Substituting \\nthis expression into Equation 14.1 gives\\n\\n w = –PADh (14.2)\\n\\nBecause the volume of a cylinder is the area of the base times the height, that is, \\nV = Ah, the change in volume of the system when the piston is displaced by Dh is \\nDV = ADh. Thus, Equation 14.2 can be rewritten as\\n\\n w = –PDV = –P(Vf – Vi) (14.3)\\n\\nwhere Vf is the final volume and Vi is the initial volume. Equation 14.3 gives the \\nwork done on a system that is compressed or expanded at a constant pressure P. \\nEquation 14.3 is especially useful in thermochemistry because many reactions \\ntake place in vessels open to the atmosphere, and the atmosphere exerts a con-\\nstant pressure during the course of the reaction.

The work is negative in this case; the energy of the gas \\ndecreases upon expansion.\\n\\nIn contrast to the transfer of energy as work, the transfer of energy as heat \\ndoes not require the application of a force. Energy transfer as heat occurs when-\\never there is a temperature difference between a system and its surroundings. \\nEnergy flows spontaneously as heat from a region of higher temperature to a \\nregion of lower temperature. We denote the energy transferred as heat by the \\nsymbol q.\\n\\nThe sign convention for heat (q) is the same as that for work (w). That is, when \\nenergy as heat is lost by the system to the surroundings, the sign of q  is negative \\n(q < 0). We call a reaction that releases energy as heat into the surroundings an \\nexothermic reaction (exo = out). Conversely, when energy as heat is transferred \\n\\n\\n\\n14. ThermochemisTry472\\n\\nfrom the surroundings into the system, the sign of q is positive (q > 0) and we call \\nthe reaction an endothermic reaction (endo = in).\\n\\nYou should realize that a system does not contain heat or work. Rather, heat \\nand work are ways in which energy is transferred, as the following analogy illus-\\ntrates. If a container is left outside in the rain, the question, “How much rain is \\nin the container?” is answered correctly as, “There is no rain in the container, \\nonly water.” Rain is the means by which water was transferred from the clouds \\nto the container.\\n\\nIn thermodynamics, the energy of a system is denoted by the symbol U. We \\ndenote the energy change of a system by DU where DU = Uf – Ui. In Chapter 1 \\nwe discussed the law of conservation of energy, which states that during any \\nprocess, energy is neither created nor destroyed. Energy can only be converted \\nfrom one form to another or transferred from one system to another. As we \\nnoted earlier, the energy of a system can change as a result of a transfer of \\nenergy as heat (q) or as work (w). Application of the law of conservation of \\nenergy to a reaction system yields\\n\\n DU = q + w (14.5)\\n\\nwhere q is the energy transferred as heat to or from the system and w is the en-\\nergy transferred as work to or from the system. Equation 14.5, which constitutes a \\nmathematical expression of the first law of thermodynamics, is simply an energy \\nbalance equation and is equivalent to the law of conservation of energy. It says \\nthat in going from some particular initial energy state to some particular final \\nenergy state, the energy transferred as work and the energy transferred as heat \\nmust always add up to give the same value as DU for the system. Because DU is \\nequal to Ufinal − Uinitial, the value of DU depends only on the initial and final states \\nof the system. The value of DU does not depend on how the system goes from the \\ninitial to the final state. In thermodynamics, functions that depend only on the \\nstate of a system and not on how that state is achieved are called state functions.\\n\\nWork and heat are not state functions, but energy transfer functions. Their \\nvalues depend on how the energy transfer is carried out or the conditions under \\nwhich the energy is transferred. Even though the individual values of q and w \\ndepend upon how the process is carried out, Equation 14.5 says that their sum \\ndoes not. Their sum is a state function.\\n\\nWe shall denote state functions by uppercase letters (for example, P  for pres-\\nsure, V  for volume, T  for temperature, and U  for energy) and energy transfer \\nfunctions by lowercase letters (for example, w  for work and q  for heat).\\n\\nIf we apply the first law of thermodynamics to a chemical reaction, then \\nEquation 14.5 becomes\\n\\n DUrxn = q + w (14.6)\\n\\nwhere the subscript rxn stands for reaction. The value of DUrxn is the energy \\nchange of the reaction.\\n\\nThe sign convention for the change in energy (DU) is the same as that for \\nthe work (w) and the heat (q). When DU < 0, energy flows from the system into \\nthe surroundings, and when DU > 0, energy is transferred from the surround-\\nings into the system. Figure 14.3 illustrates the relationships between the sys-\\ntem, the surroundings, and the work, heat, and energy transferred.\\n\\n\\n\\n14-2. enThaLPy is a sTaTe FuncTion 473\\n\\n14-2. enthalpy is a state Function\\nAs we have already noted, the energy transferred as heat is not a state function. \\nThis creates a problem because if the energy evolved as heat by a reaction de-\\npends upon the conditions under which the reaction is run, then it is possible \\nfor different laboratories to obtain different measurements of this quantity for \\nthe same reaction, depending on how that reaction is carried out. In this sec-\\ntion we shall introduce a new state function, called enthalpy, that does not de-\\npend on how a reaction is carried out.\\n\\nMany chemical reactions occur at constant pressure (for example, open to \\nthe atmosphere). For reactions that occur at constant pressure, it is convenient \\nto introduce a thermodynamic state function H, called enthalpy, for the reac-\\ntion system, defined by the equation\\n\\n H = U + PV (14.7)\\n\\nApplication of Equation 14.7 to a chemical reaction yields\\n\\n DHrxn = Hf – Hi = DUrxn + D(PV )rxn (14.8)\\n\\nwhere DHrxn is the enthalpy change of the reaction.\\nWe can express the D(PV )rxn term in this equation as\\n\\nD(PV )rxn = PfVf – PiVi\\n\\nin terms of the final and initial values of the pressure and the volume. If the \\nreaction occurs at constant pressure, then Pf = Pi = P, and so\\n\\n D(PV )rxn = P(Vf – Vi) = PDVrxn (14.9)\\n\\nSubstituting Equation 14.9 into Equation 14.8, we have\\n\\n DHrxn = DUrxn + PDVrxn  (constant pressure) (14.10)\\n\\nFrom this equation we see that the difference between DUrxn and DHrxn is just the \\nenergy that is required for the system to expand or contract against a constant \\nexternal pressure. The difference between DUrxn and DHrxn is usually small, as \\nwe shall show in the next section.\\n\\nq > 0 (endothermic)\\n\\nq < 0 (exothermic) \\n\\nw >  0 (compression)\\n\\nw < 0 (expansion)\\nSystem\\n\\nSurroundings\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n09/11/09\\n\\n 014-003\\n\\nx\\n\\nFigure 14.3 By convention, when energy \\nin the form of work is transferred from \\nthe system to the surroundings the \\nsign of the work is negative (w < 0), \\nand when it is transferred from the \\nsurroundings to the system the sign is \\npositive (w > 0).

Thus, we see that the enthalpy change for a reaction has the \\nuseful property that\\n\\n �Hrxn = qP =\\nenergy evolved or absorbed\\nas heat at constant pressure� � (14.12)\\n\\nBecause enthalpy is a state function, we can tabulate values for the change in \\nenthalpy of various reactions regardless of how a particular experiment is car-\\nried out. As we shall see in the upcoming sections, these values have a wide \\nrange of chemical applications.\\n\\nIn Chapter 10 we found that fuels are reactants that are oxidized to provide \\nenergy as heat.

For an endo-\\nthermic reaction, Hprod is greater than Hreact, so DHrxn > 0.\\n\\nWhen specifying a value for the enthalpy change of a particular chemical \\nreaction that takes place at a pressure of one bar, we use the notation DH°rxn. \\nThe superscript degree sign tells us that the enthalpy change is the standard \\nenthalpy change for the reaction. The standard enthalpy change refers to pure \\nreactants at a pressure of one bar and to pure products at a pressure of one bar. \\nThese states are called the standard states for substances. The standard state \\nfor a solute is a one-molar (1 M) solution of the solute.\\n\\nWhen stating the numerical value of the standard enthalpy change of a \\nreaction, we must include both the value of DH°rxn and the corresponding chem-\\nical equation. For example, the chemical equation describing the standard \\nenthalpy change for the reaction of H2(g) and O2(g) can be written as\\n\\n 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l) (14.14)\\n 1 bar 1 bar 1 bar\\n\\nfor which we find experimentally that DH°rxn = –571.6 kJ·mol–1 at 25°C. The \\nnegative value of DH°rxn tells us that the reaction is exothermic. The subscript \\nrxn means that DH°rxn is expressed in units of kilojoules per mole for the chemi-\\ncal equation as written; in other words, the value of DH°rxn stated is the enthalpy \\nchange for the reaction of two moles of H2(g) with one mole of O2(g) at 25°C and \\na pressure of one bar. If instead we had chosen to represent the reaction by the \\nequation\\n\\n  H2(g) + \\n1_\\n2O2(g) → H2O(l) (14.15)\\n\\n  1 bar     1 bar        1 bar\\n\\nthen the corresponding value of DH°rxn would be –285.8 kJ·mol–1 at 25°C and a \\nconstant pressure of one bar, meaning that this is the value of DH°rxn when one \\nmole of H2(g) reacts with half a mole of O2(g) under these conditions. We see \\nthen that both the chemical equation and the corresponding value of DH°rxn \\nmust be given. Simply stating that DH°rxn = –571.6 kJ for the reaction of H2(g) \\nwith O2(g) is ambiguous.\\n\\nEnthalpies of reactions may be used to predict the amount of energy trans-\\nferred as heat during a given process, as the following Example illustrates.\\n\\n∆Hrxn < 0\\n(exothermic, heat released)\\n\\n∆Hrxn > 0\\n(endothermic, heat absorbed)\\n\\nIn\\ncr\\n\\nea\\nsi\\n\\nng\\n e\\n\\nnt\\nha\\n\\nlp\\ny,\\n\\n H\\n\\nReactants\\n\\nReactants\\n\\nProducts\\n\\nProducts\\n\\n(a) (b)\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n07/01/09\\n\\n014-006 (252)\\n\\nFigure 14.6 An enthalpy diagram \\nfor (a) an exothermic reaction and \\n(b) an endothermic reaction.

The Difference Between the Values of DH°rxn and DU°rxn \\nis usually small\\n\\nThe relationship between DH°rxn and DU°rxn is given by Equation 14.10.\\n\\n DH°rxn = DU°rxn + PDV°rxn (constant pressure) (14.16)\\n\\nwith P  equal to exactly one bar (recall that the superscript degree sign implies \\nthat these quantities are for a pressure of one bar). This equation shows that \\nthe difference between the values of DH°rxn and DU°rxn is determined by the value \\nof PDV°rxn at a pressure of one bar. Notice again that the subscript rxn on DV°rxn \\nmeans that this term in Equation 14.16 is interpreted as the change in the molar \\nvolume of gas (with units of volume per mole) for the corresponding chemical \\nequation as written. Because the molar volume of a gas at one bar is about 1700 \\ntimes greater than the molar volume of a liquid or a solid, only the volume \\nterms corresponding to gaseous products or gaseous reactants will make an \\nappreciable contribution to the value of DV°rxn. For example, for the reaction \\ndescribed by\\n\\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l)  DH°rxn = –571.6 kJ·mol–1\\n\\nwe have\\n\\nDV°rxn = V°prod – V°react = 2 V°H2O(l) – (2 V°H2(g) + V°O2(g)) ≈ –2 V°H2(g) – V°O2(g)   \\n\\nor\\n\\nPDV°rxn ≈ –2 PV°H2(g) – PV°O2(g)\\n\\nBecause V°H2(g) and V°O2(g) represent molar volumes of these gases, from the ideal-\\ngas equation, PV = nRT, applied to exactly one mole (n  = 1) of each gas, we \\nobtain\\n\\nPV°H2(g) = RT  and  PV°O2(g) = RT\\n\\nThus, for this reaction at 25°C, we have\\n\\nPDV°rxn = –2 PV°H2(g) – PV°O2(g) = –2 RT – RT = –3 RT\\n\\nAs another example, consider the reaction for the decomposition of potas-\\nsium chlorate, KClO3(s), to generate O2(g) according to\\n\\n2 KClO3(s) → 2 KCl(s) + 3 O2(g)\\n\\nIn this case,\\n\\nDV°rxn = 2 V°KCl(s) + 3 V°O2(g) – 2 V°KClO3(s) ≈ 3 V°O2(g)\\n\\nand\\n\\nPDV°rxn = 3 V°O2(g) = 3 RT\\n\\n14-3.

Equation 14.20 can be generalized to cover \\nmultiplication of a chemical equation by any numerical factor n. For example, \\nn [SO2(g) → S(s) + O2(g)] becomes n SO2(g) → n S(s) + n O2(g). Multiplication \\nof the chemical equation by n  is equivalent to writing the equation out n  times \\nand adding the n  equations together, so the value of DH°rxn for the resulting \\nequation is\\n\\n DH°rxn = n DH°rxn(1) (14.21)\\n\\nNow let’s consider the following combination of chemical equations:\\n\\n(1) SO2(g) → S(s) + O2(g)  DH°rxn(1)\\n\\n(2) S(s) + O2(g) → SO2(g)  DH°rxn(2)\\n\\nThe value of DH°rxn for the sum of these two equations is \\n\\nDH°rxn(1 + 2) = DH°rxn(1) + DH°rxn(2) \\n\\nBut the addition of these two equations yields no net reactants and no net prod-\\nucts or, in other words, no net chemical change whatsoever. Because there is \\nno net change, the value of DH°rxn(1+2) must be zero and we conclude that \\nDH°rxn(2) = –DH°rxn(1). Because equation (2) above is simply the reverse of equa-\\ntion (1), we conclude from Hess’s law that\\n\\n DH°rxn(reverse) = –DH°rxn(forward) (14.22)\\n\\nEquation 14.22 is easy to apply. If we reverse a chemical equation, then the \\nreactants become the products and the products become the reactants, and so \\nthe sign of DH°rxn changes.

The difference in elevation between these two points is 9270 meters. \\nIf instead of sea level we had chosen to take the Dead Sea as our arbitrary zero \\npoint for determining elevation, then the height of the Dead Sea would be zero \\nmeters, and that of Mt.

When studying chemical reactions, what we are \\ninterested in is the change (or difference) in enthalpy between the products and \\nthe reactants. This quantity is independent of what we select as our reference \\nstate, and so we simply choose the one of greatest convenience, which for our \\npurposes is pure elements in their normal physical state at one bar.\\n\\nTable 14.3 lists values of DH°f at 25°C for a number of substances. If you \\nlook at Table 14.3, you will see that DH°f [C(diamond)] = +1.897 kJ·mol−1, DH°f \\n[Br2(g)] = +30.9 kJ·mol−1, and DH°f [I2(g)] = +62.4 kJ·mol−1. The DH°f values \\nfor these forms of the elements are not equal to zero because C(diamond), \\nBr2(g), and I2(g) are not the most stable physical states of these elements at \\n25°C and one bar. The most stable physical states of these elements at 25°C are \\nC(graphite), Br2(l), and I2(s).\\n\\nOnce we have tabulated standard molar enthalpies of formation, we can \\nthen use Hess’s law to calculate the standard enthalpy change of any chemical \\nequation for which we know the DH°f values of all the products and reactants. \\nFor example, let’s consider one of the reactions that is used in the production of \\ntin from its principal ore, cassiterite, SnO2(s), which we write as\\n\\n(1) SnO2(s) + C(s) → Sn(s) + CO2(g)\\n\\nWe can write this equation as the sum of the two equations,\\n\\n(2) C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)\\n\\n(3) SnO2(s) → Sn(s) + O2(g)\\n\\nNotice that DH°rxn for equation (2) is equal to DH°f [CO2(g)].

The common unit for the energy content \\nof food is the calorie (cal). A calorie was formerly defined as the amount \\nof energy in the form of heat required to raise the temperature of one \\ngram of water from 14.5°C to 15.5°C (one degree Celsius). In the SI unit \\nsystem, a calorie is defined as exactly 4.184 J. The calorie used to be the \\nunit of energy used in thermochemistry, but it has been replaced by the \\njoule. The popular term “calorie” used by nutritionists, physicians, and \\nthe popular press is actually a kilocalorie and is sometimes written Calo-\\nrie (abbreviated Cal) with a capital C. This is the term that appears on \\nnutritional labels throughout the United States. Thus, 4184 J = 1000 cal = \\n1 kcal = 1 nutritional Calorie. About 100 kJ per kilogram of body weight \\nper day is required to keep the body functioning at a minimal level.\\n\\nIf we consume more food than we require for our normal activity level, \\nthen the excess that is not eliminated is stored in the body as fat. One gram \\nof body fat contains about 39 kJ of stored energy. Carbohydrates and pro-\\nteins have less than one-half the energy content of fats per gram. A one-hour \\nbrisk walk over average terrain consumes only about 700 kJ of stored energy. \\nThe message is that calories (or better, kilojoules) count.\\n\\nFigure 14.13 A Sterno burner in \\noperation.

The molar enthalpy of combustion data in \\nTable 14.4 shows that the most energy-rich fuel on a per mass basis is hydrogen, \\nwhich has an energy content per gram of well over twice that of the next-best \\nfuel. Because of its unusually high energy content per gram, and because the \\nfuel must be lifted as part of the space vehicle, liquid hydrogen was used in \\nthe first stage of the Apollo spaceships that traveled to the moon and is the \\nfuel carried in the Space Shuttle’s external tank that is used to help lift it into \\norbit. The main disadvantages of liquid hydrogen as a fuel are that H2(l) can be \\nmaintained as a liquid only at very low temperatures (about 20 K at 1 bar) and \\nthat hydrogen readily forms explosive mixtures with air.

To \\nutilize this available oxygen and thereby to provide more rocket thrust, aluminum \\npowder and a binder are added. The aluminum is oxidized to aluminum oxide:\\n\\n4 Al(s) + 3 O2(g) → 2 Al2O3(s)\\n\\nand the binder is oxidized to CO2(g) and H2O(g). The aluminum powder also \\npromotes a more rapid and even decomposition of the NH4ClO4(s).\\n\\n14-6.  The Value of DH°rxn is Determined Primarily by the Difference \\nin the molar Bond enthalpies of the reactant and Product \\nmolecules\\n\\nNow that we know more about the role of DH°rxn in reactions, let’s see what mo-\\nlecular properties of reactants and products give rise to the observed values of \\nDH°rxn.\\n\\nThe enthalpy change for the equation\\n\\nH2O(g) → O(g) + 2 H(g)\\n\\nis DH°rxn = +925 kJ. We know that there are two oxygen-hydrogen bonds in a \\nwater molecule (H–O–H). The positive value of DH°rxn indicates that an in-\\nput of 925 kJ of energy is required to break the two moles of oxygen-hydrogen \\nbonds in one mole of water molecules. Thus, the average molar bond enthalpy, \\nHbond(oxygen-hydrogen) in a water molecule is equal to one-half the total en-\\nergy required to break the two moles of oxygen-hydrogen bonds:\\n\\nHbond(O–H) = \\n1_\\n2 (+925 kJ·mol\\n\\n–1) = +463 kJ·mol–1\\n\\nStrictly speaking, this is the average O–H molar bond enthalpy of a water mol-\\necule. The values of the oxygen-hydrogen molar bond enthalpies in a variety of \\ncompounds are found to have about the same value as the O–H molar bond \\nenthalpy in a water molecule. For example, the standard enthalpy change for the \\nreaction described by\\n\\nH C (g)  +  H (g)\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nOH C (g)\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nO H\\n\\nin which a single oxygen-hydrogen bond is broken, is DH°rxn = +464 kJ·mol–1, \\nwhich is very similar to that of the O–H bond in a water molecule.\\n\\nFigure 14.14 Underwater firing of a \\nPolaris A-3 test missile from a nuclear \\nsubmarine.\\n\\n\\n\\n493\\n\\nIn general, we can picture a chemical reaction as taking place in two steps \\n(Figure 14.15). In Step 1 the reactant molecules are broken down into their con-\\nstituent atoms, and in Step 2 the atoms are rejoined to form the product mol-\\necules. Step 1 requires an input of energy to break all the bonds in the reactant \\nmolecules, whereas Step 2 evolves energy as the bonds in the product molecules \\nare formed. The total enthalpy change for the equation is\\n\\n �H°rxn � –\\nenergy evolved as heat \\n\\nupon the formation\\nof all the bonds in the\\n\\nproduct molecules\\n� �\\n\\nenergy required \\nto break all the \\n\\nbonds in the \\nreactant molecules\\n\\n� �   (14.25)\\nEquation 14.25 is simply an accounting of the energy involved in the break-\\n\\ning and the formation of the bonds of the species involved in the reaction. \\nThe energy required to break all the bonds in the reactant molecules is equal \\nto Hbond [reactants], the sum of the molar bond enthalpies for all the reactant \\nbonds. The energy evolved as heat upon the formation of all the bonds in the \\nproduct molecules is equal to –Hbond [products], the sum of the molar bond \\nenthalpies for all the product bonds in the chemical equation for the reaction. \\nThe negative sign in –Hbond [products] occurs because the formation of the \\nbonds is the reverse of the breaking of the bonds. Thus, we can write Equation \\n14.25 as\\n\\n DH°rxn ≈ Hbond [reactants] – Hbond [products] (14.26)\\n\\nThe reason for the “approximately equals to sign” here is that molar bond \\nenthalpies are average  values and so values of DH°rxn calculated based on average \\nmolar bond enthalpies are only approximations to actual experimental values. \\nNotice the similarity of Equation 14.26 to Equation 14.24, but with the enthal-\\npies of the product molecules and reactant moecules reversed; this arises from \\nthe fact that molar bond enthalpies are defined as the enthalpy required to \\nbreak one mole of a given bond, whereas molar enthalpies of formation are \\ndefined as the enthalpy released upon the formation of one mole of bonds.\\n\\nWe see from either Equation 14.25 or 14.26 that if more energy is released \\non formation of the product bonds than is required to break the reactant bonds, \\nthen the value of DH°rxn is negative (energy released; exothermic). If less energy \\nis released on the formation of the product bonds than is required to break the \\nreactant bonds, then the value of DH°rxn is positive (energy consumed; endother-\\nmic). Thus, the value of DH°rxn is determined primarily by the difference in the \\nmolar bond enthalpies of the reactant and product molecules. Values of average \\nmolar bond enthalpies for a variety of chemical bonds are given in Table 14.5.\\n\\n14-6.

ThermochemisTry494\\n\\nIn most cases we can use Hess’s law and tables of standard enthalpies of \\nformation to determine the enthalpy of a reaction as we did in Section 14-5. \\nHowever, in some cases we need to estimate the enthalpy of a reaction for which \\nno experimental data are available, or we simply want a “quick estimate” of the \\nenthalpy of reaction without searching for molar enthalpy of formation values \\nin the literature.

For this reason, \\nthe calculation of DH°rxn values from molar bond enthalpies alone is restricted to \\ngas-phase reactions. Again, keep in mind that the values in Table 14.5 are average \\nvalues and that values of DH°rxn determined using molar bond enthalpies are only \\napproximations to the actual experimentally determined values.\\n\\n14-7.  heat capacity measures the ability of a substance  \\nto Take up energy as heat\\n\\nThe DH°f values given in Table 14.3 are derived from experimentally determined \\nenthalpies of reaction. We shall see how to measure enthalpies of reaction in \\nthe next section, but first we must introduce a quantity called heat capacity.\\n\\nThe heat capacity of a sample of a substance is defined as the energy in the \\nform of heat required to raise the temperature of the sample by one degree \\nCelsius, or equivalently, by one kelvin (see sidebox). If the substance is heated \\nat constant pressure, then the heat capacity is denoted by cP, where the subscript \\nP denotes constant pressure. We can write an equation for the definition of the \\nheat capacity at constant pressure:\\n\\n cP =\\nqP—\\n�T\\n\\n (14.27)\\n\\nBecause qP = DH (Equation 14.12), Equation 14.27 can also be written as\\n\\n cP =\\n�H\\n—\\n�T\\n\\n (14.28)\\n\\nThe change in TemPeraTure in Degrees ceLsius is \\nequiVaLenT To The change in KeLVin\\n\\nDT(K) = Dt(°C)\\n\\nTo show the validity of this equation, realize that the Kelvin and Celsius \\nscales differ by a constant amount because\\n\\nT/K = t/°C + 273.15\\n\\nTherefore, if we let Tinitial = tinitial + 273.15 and Tfinal = tfinal + 273.15, then\\n\\nTfinal – Tinitial = (tfinal + 273.15) – (tinitial + 273.15) = tfinal  – tinitial\\n\\nor\\n\\nDT = Dt\\n\\n\\n\\n14-7.  heaT caPaciTy measures The aBiLiTy oF a suBsTance To TaKe uP energy 497\\n\\nThus,\\n\\n qP = DH = cPDT (14.29)\\n\\nwhere qP is the energy added as heat at constant pressure and DT is the in-\\ncrease in temperature of the substance arising from the energy input. All that \\nis needed to determine the heat capacity of a substance is to add a known quan-\\ntity of energy as heat and then measure the resulting increase in temperature \\nat some fixed pressure. The heat capacity of a substance is always positive. The \\nfollowing Example illustrates the use of Equation 14.27.\\n\\neXamPLe 14-10: When 4.219 kJ of energy are added as heat to 36.0 grams \\nof water at one bar, the temperature of the water increases from 10.00°C to \\n38.05°C.

(A capital C  is used to denote molar heat capacity.) The heat \\ncapacity per mole of water can be computed from the  value of 150.4 J·K−1 for \\n36.0 grams of water calculated in Example 14-10. Because one mole of water has \\na mass of 18.016 grams, the value of CP for water is\\n\\n(36.0 g)\\n\\n150.4 J·K–1\\n—\\n\\n1 mol\\n—\\n18.016 g� �\\n\\nCP = = 75.3 J·mol\\n–1·K–1\\n\\nNotice from this expression that CP = cp/n.

Specific heats are especially useful in dealing with heat capacities \\nof substances for which we cannot write a chemical formula, such as glass, steel, \\nwood, or cement.

A simple calorimeter, consisting of a Dewar flask (“thermos bottle”) \\nequipped with a high-precision thermometer, is shown in Figure 14.17. A calorim-\\neter works on the principle that the total energy is always conserved. For a chemi-\\ncal reaction occurring at fixed pressure, the value of DH is equal to the energy \\nevolved or absorbed as heat by the reaction. Consider an exothermic reaction run \\nin a Dewar flask. The energy evolved as heat by the reaction cannot escape from \\nthe flask, so it is absorbed by the calorimeter contents (reaction mixture, ther-\\nmometer, stirrer, and so on). The absorption of the energy evolved as heat by the \\ncalorimeter contents leads to an increase in the temperature of the calorimeter \\ncontents.

The energy of reaction can Be measured in a Bomb \\ncalorimeter\\n\\nLet’s go back to the equation:\\n\\n DUrxn = q + w (14.37)\\n\\nIf a reaction occurs in a rigid, closed container, then there is no change in \\nvolume (DV = 0), and so no energy is transferred as work (w = –PDV = 0). In this \\ncase, Equation 14.37 becomes\\n\\n �Urxn = qV =\\nenergy evolved or absorbed\\nas heat at constant volume� � (14.38)\\n\\nThe subscript V on q  emphasizes that qV is the energy evolved or absorbed as \\nheat when the volume of the reaction system is constant. Because we have speci-\\nfied the manner in which the reaction takes place, qV = DUrxn is a state function. \\nEquation 14.38 is the constant volume analog of Equation 14.12.\\n\\nLet’s think about the difference between a reaction run at constant volume \\nand one run at constant pressure. In the case of a reaction run at constant pres-\\nsure, any gas that is produced has to expend energy as work to push back the \\nsurrounding atmosphere, whereas one run at constant volume does no work. \\nBecause DUrxn = q  + w is a state function, the sum of q and w must be the same for \\nboth reactions. Therefore, q, the energy evolved or absorbed as heat in a reac-\\ntion run at constant pressure (where w ≠ 0), is not the same as that for the reac-\\ntion run at constant volume (where w = 0).\\n\\nThe value of DU for the combustion of a substance can be determined in \\na bomb calorimeter like that shown in Figure 14.18. A bomb calorimeter has \\na fixed total volume; thus, the reaction takes place at constant volume, and so \\nEquation 14.38 applies. A known mass of the substance whose energy of com-\\nbustion is to be determined is loaded into the bomb calorimeter along with an \\nignition wire. The calorimeter is then pressurized with excess oxygen gas at \\nabout 30 bar. The combustion reaction is initiated by passing a short burst of \\nhigh-voltage current through the ignition wire. The value of DU of combustion \\nis determined by measuring the temperature increase of the calorimeter and of \\nthe water in which it is immersed. From the known heat capacity of the calorim-\\neter assembly and the observed value of DT, the value of DU can be computed in \\na manner analogous to that described for the Dewar-flask calorimeter.\\n\\nAlthough a bomb calorimeter gives us a value of DU rather than DH, we can \\nusually assume that DH  ≈ DU, as shown in the next Example.\\n\\n\\n\\n14.

Even so, \\nthe value of DUrxn that is obtained is close to the standard (one bar) value, DU°rxn.\\n\\n14-10.  The magnitudes of heat capacities have a molecular \\ninterpretation\\n\\nIf you look at the values of the constant-pressure molar heat capacities given \\nin Table 14.6, you will see that all the monatomic gases—He(g), Ne(g), Ar(g), \\nHg(g)—have a CP value of 20.8 J·mol−1·K−1 at 25°C. Being monatomic, these spe-\\ncies can increase their energy only by traveling at a faster speed. Polyatomic \\nmolecules, on the other hand, can take up energy in other ways. In addition to \\nmoving along in a straight line (called translational motion), polyatomic mol-\\necules can rotate and vibrate, as shown in Figure 14.19. Energy can be taken \\nup by these rotational and vibrational motions, in addition to the translational \\nmotion, so the polyatomic gases in Table 14.6—for instance, H2(g), NH3(g), and \\nCH4(g)—all have values of CP that are greater than 20.8 J·K−1·mol−1. Each poly-\\natomic gaseous molecule rotates and vibrates to a different extent at different \\ntemperatures, so we can only say that CP > 20.8 J·mol−1·K−1 in each case. However, \\ngenerally speaking, the larger the molecule, the greater the number of ways in \\nwhich it can rotate and vibrate, and therefore, the greater its heat capacity.\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)\\n\\n(c)\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n09/11/09\\n\\n014-019 (270)\\n\\nx\\n\\nFigure 14.19 Molecular motion \\nmay be translational, rotational, or \\nvibrational.

ThermochemisTry506\\n\\nWe can derive the value of CP for  monatomic gases (20.8 J·mol−1·K−1) by \\nusing Equation 13.26 from the kinetic theory of gases, which says that the mean \\nkinetic energy per mole of a gas is \\n\\n—\\nEk = 3–2 RT. Excluding electronic energy, kinetic \\n\\nenergy is the only energy available to a monatomic gas, so we can associate \\n—\\nEk \\n\\nwith the thermodynamic energy U. Thus, we can write\\n\\n DU = Uf – Ui = 3–2 RTf – \\n3–\\n2 \\nRTi = 3–2 R(Tf – Ti) = \\n\\n3–\\n2 \\nRDT (14.39)\\n\\nIf we substitute DU = 3–\\n2 \\nRDT into Equation 14.8, DH = DU + D(PV ), we obtain\\n\\n DH = 3–\\n2 \\nRDT + D(PV ) (14.40)\\n\\nBut PV = RT for one mole of an ideal gas, and so D(PV) = D(RT) = RDT. If we sub-\\nstitute this result into Equation 14.40 for DH, we obtain\\n\\n DH = 3–\\n2 \\nRDT + RDT = 5–\\n\\n2 \\nRDT (14.41)\\n\\nUsing this result in Equation 14.28 (where n = 1) gives\\n\\n = 5–2R=CP =\\n5–2R�T—\\n\\n�T\\n�H\\n—\\n�T\\n\\n (14.42)\\n\\nFinally, substituting R = 8.3145 J·mol−1·K−1 into this equation gives CP = \\n20.78 J·mol−1·K−1, in agreement with the values listed in Table 14.6 for the mona-\\ntomic gases. Thus, the kinetic theory of gases actually enables us to calculate the \\ncorrect experimental values of the molar heat capacities of monatomic gases.\\n\\nAnother correspondence in Table 14.6 can be found by looking at the val-\\nues of CP for the solid metals: Al(s), Au(s), Cu(s), Fe(s), Ag(s), and Li(s), for \\nexample. Notice that in each case the value of CP is approximately equal to \\n3 R = 3(8.3145 J·mol−1·K−1) = 24.9 J·mol−1·K−1. This observation, which is easy to \\nuse but has a theoretical explanation too involved to give here, was observed \\nexperimentally in the early 1800s by two French chemists, Pierre Dulong and \\nAlexis Petit, and is known as the rule of Dulong and Petit. This rule played an \\nimportant role in the early investigations of atomic masses and the chemical \\nformulas of compounds.\\n\\nOne final observation to be made regarding Table 14.6 is the relatively large \\nheat capacity of liquid water, which is twice as large as the heat capacity of ice. \\nBecause of its large heat capacity, a given quantity of water is able to absorb \\na relatively large quantity of energy as heat, so water is an excellent coolant. \\nWe shall see in Chapter 15 that water molecules have rather strong intermo-\\nlecular interactions in the liquid state and that the relatively large amount of \\nenergy that is absorbed as heat goes into breaking up these interactions as well \\nas increasing the temperature.\\n\\n\\n\\nTerms you shouLD KnoW 507\\n\\nsummary\\nA chemical reaction involves a transfer of energy between the reaction system \\nand its surroundings. The transfer of energy can be as work or heat. Work \\ninvolves the action of a force through a distance. When the work is positive, \\na system gains energy, and when the work is negative, the system loses energy. \\nReactions that give off energy as heat are called exothermic reactions, and \\nreactions that take in energy as heat are called endothermic reactions. The \\ntotal energy involved is always conserved; that is, energy is neither created nor \\ndestroyed, but simply transferred from one system to another, a principle known \\nas the first law of thermodynamics. The study of energy transfers is called ther-\\nmodynamics; and thermochemistry is the branch of thermodynamics that deals \\nwith the energy evolved or absorbed as heat in chemical reactions.\\n\\nFor a reaction run at constant pressure, the energy evolved or absorbed as \\nheat, qP, is equal to the enthalpy change; thus, DHrxn = qP. The state function \\nproperty of the enthalpy leads to Hess’s law that states that the enthalpy changes \\nfor chemical equations are additive. For a constant-volume process, the energy \\nevolved or absorbed as heat, qV, is equal to the change in energy for the reac-\\ntion; thus, DUrxn = qV.\\n\\nThe standard molar enthalpy of formation of a compound from its elements, \\nDH°f, is determined by assigning a value of zero to the standard enthalpies of \\nformation of the most stable state of each element at a pressure of one bar. A \\ntable of DH°f values can be used to compute DH°rxn values.\\n\\nThe molar bond enthalpy is defined as the enthalpy required to break one \\nmole of a given bond. A table of average molar bond enthalpies can be used to \\ncompute approximate DH°rxn values.\\n\\nThe heat capacity of a substance is a measure of its capacity to take up energy \\nas heat. The higher the heat capacity of a substance, the smaller the resulting \\ntemperature increase for a given amount of energy in the form of heat added. \\n\\nCombustion reactions are those in which a fuel is burned (usually in oxy-\\ngen) to provide energy in the form of heat. The amount of energy absorbed or \\nevolved as heat by a chemical reaction can be measured using a calorimeter.\\n\\nTerms you shouLD KnoW\\nthermochemistry 469\\nsystem 470\\nsurroundings 470\\nthermodynamics 470\\nwork, w 470\\nliter-atmosphere, L·atm 471\\nheat, q 471\\nexothermic reaction 471\\nendothermic reaction 472\\nenergy change, DU 472\\nfirst law of thermodynamics 472\\nstate function 472\\nenergy transfer function 472\\n\\nenergy change of a reaction, \\nDUrxn 472\\n\\nenthalpy, H 473\\nenthalpy change of a reaction, \\n\\nDHrxn 473\\nfuel 474\\nstandard enthalpy change, \\n\\nDH°rxn 475\\nstandard state 475\\nHess’s law 479\\ncyclic process 480\\nstandard molar enthalpy of  \\n\\nformation, DH°f 484\\n\\ncalorie, cal 490\\nmolar bond enthalpy 492\\nheat capacity, cP 496\\nmolar heat capacity, CP 497\\nspecific heat, csp 499\\ncalorimeter 501\\nDewar flask 501\\nbomb calorimeter 503\\ntranslational motion 505\\nrotational motion 505\\nvibrational motion 505\\nrule of Dulong and Petit 506\\n\\n\\n\\n14.

Liquids and Solids\\n\\nYour study of chemistry has taken you from a fundamental understanding of how atoms combine to form compounds to calculations involving chemi-\\ncal equations. Now we begin to build on our picture of molecular structure in \\norder to predict chemical changes and the properties of matter. In this chapter, \\nwe discuss how the behavior of liquids and solids depends on the attraction \\nbetween molecules.\\n\\nIf molecules did not attract one another, then gases would not condense \\ninto liquids. Without an orderly arrangement of atoms in a solid, a diamond \\nwould not retain its hardness and the “lead” in pencils its softness. In this chap-\\nter we shall discuss these and other properties of liquids and solids in terms of \\nintermolecular forces. We shall examine the processes of melting, freezing, and \\nvaporization and then introduce phase diagrams that give the temperatures \\nand pressures at which a substance occurs as a solid, a liquid, or a gas. We then \\ndiscuss how various types of crystal structures are described and how these con-\\ntrast with other solids. Finally, we briefly discuss liquid crystals and colloids.\\n\\n15-1.  The Molecules in Solids and Liquids  \\nAre Close to One Another\\n\\nWe learned in Chapter 13 that the molecules in a gas are in constant motion, \\ntraveling distances more than a hundred molecular diameters between colli-\\nsions at one bar. In addition to traveling in straight lines (translational motion), \\nthe molecules rotate and vibrate freely as they travel between collisions (Figure \\n15.1). Because the average distance between the molecules is so large, gases \\nhave low densities and can be readily compressed. In addition, the volume of a \\ngas is always the same as the volume of its container.\\n\\nBy contrast, the molecules of a solid are close together and restricted to \\nfixed positions in space. The molecules vibrate about these fixed positions, \\nbut they usually do not rotate or move easily from site to site. The molecules in \\na liquid are also close together, but they are not restricted to fixed positions; \\nthey rotate and move throughout the fluid. The molecules in a liquid are es-\\nsentially in constant interaction with one another, and the distance that a mol-\\necule travels between collisions is usually less than a molecular diameter.

The molecular distinctions be-\\ntween a solid, a liquid, and a gas are summarized in Table 15.1.\\n\\nBecause the particles in solids are fixed in space and are not able to move \\nfrom site to site, a solid body has a fixed shape, and the volume and shape of a \\nsolid are independent of its container. Although the molecules in a liquid are \\nessentially in continual contact with one another, they are able to move past one \\nanother and move throughout the liquid. Thus, unlike a solid body, a liquid can \\nbe poured from one container to another. Furthermore, a liquid has a fixed \\nvolume because the molecules are constantly attracting one another. But, un-\\nlike a solid, a liquid assumes the shape of its container because its constituent \\nmolecules are not held in fixed positions in space.\\n\\nLiquids and solids have densities that are about a thousand times greater \\nthan the densities of gases at one atm. The densities of gases are often ex-\\npressed in units of grams per liter, whereas the densities of liquids and solids are \\nexpressed in units of grams per milliliter or grams per cubic centimeter. The \\nrelative densities of gases, liquids, and solids imply that the distances between \\nmolecules in liquids and solids are much smaller than they are in gases.\\n\\nThe molar volume of a substance is a direct indication of the average sepa-\\nration between the molecules. The molar volume of the liquid phase of a com-\\npound is approximately equal to the molar volume of the solid phase of the \\nsame compound. Yet the molar volume of a gas is much larger than that of a \\nliquid or a solid at the same pressure and temperature. The molar volumes for \\nsolid, liquid, and gaseous water at 0°C and 100.0°C at one atm are shown in \\nTable 15.2.

At 0°C, the temperature \\nremains constant for 60 min even though the ice is being heated at a constant \\nrate of 100 J?min–1. The energy as heat being added at 0°C melts the ice to liquid \\nwater. The temperature of the ice-water mixture remains at 0°C until all the ice \\nis melted. The energy absorbed as heat that is required to melt one mole of any \\nsubstance is called the molar enthalpy of fusion and is denoted by DHfus. The \\nexperimental data plotted in Figure 15.2 show that 60.1 minutes are required to \\nmelt one mole of ice when heat is added at the rate of 100.0 J?min–1; so the molar \\nenthalpy of fusion for ice is given by\\n\\nDHfus = (60.1 min?mol–1)(100.0 J?min–1) = 6010 J?mol–1 = 6.01 kJ?mol–1\\n\\nAfter all the ice is melted, and not until then, the temperature increases \\nfrom 0°C. The temperature continues to increase until 100.0°C, the boiling \\npoint of water, is reached. At 100.0°C, the temperature remains constant for \\n406.5 minutes even though heat is being added at a rate of 100.0 J?min–1. The \\nenergy being absorbed at 100.0°C vaporizes the liquid water to water vapor.  \\nThe temperature of the liquid-vapor mixture remains at 100.0°C until all the \\nwater is vaporized. The energy absorbed as heat that is required to vaporize \\none mole of any substance is called the molar enthalpy of vaporization and is \\ndenoted by DHvap. According to Figure 15.2, the value of DHvap for water is\\n\\nDHvap = (406.5 min?mol–1)(100.0 J?min–1) = 40 650 J?mol–1 = 40.65 kJ?mol–1\\n\\nOnce all the water is vaporized, the temperature increases from 100.0°C, as \\nshown in Figure 15.2.\\n\\nThe horizontal portions of the heating curve of a pure substance repre-\\nsent the enthalpy of fusion and the enthalpy of vaporization. The other regions \\nrepresent pure phases being heated at a constant rate. We learned in Chapter \\n14 that it requires energy to raise the temperature of a substance. The heat \\nabsorbed in raising the temperature of a substance from T1 to T2 at constant \\npressure without a change in phase is given by\\n\\n\\t qP = nCP(T2 – T1) = nCPDT (15.1)\\n\\n(see Equation 14.30), where CP is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure \\nand n  is the number of moles. Recall that the heat capacity is the measure of \\nthe ability of a substance to take up energy as heat. Different rates of tempera-\\nture increase for H2O(s), H2O(l), and H2O(g) appear in Figure 15.2 (steep seg-\\nments of the heating curve) because\\n\\nCP[H2O(l)] > CP[H2O(s)] > CP[H2O(g)]\\n\\n15-3.  energy is required to Melt a Solid and to vaporize a Liquid\\n\\nThe melting, or fusion, of one mole of ice can be represented by\\n\\nH2O(s) → H2O(l)            DHfus = 6.01 kJ?mol–1\\n\\n\\n\\n15-3. energy iS requireD TO MeLT A SOLiD AnD TO vAPOrize A LiquiD 523\\n\\nor, in general, we write\\n\\nX(s) → X(l)            DHfus\\n\\nwhere X stands for any element or compound.

Gas phase molecules are so far apart \\nfrom one another that they interact only very weakly relative to liquid phase \\nmolecules. Essentially, all the energy put in as enthalpy of vaporization is re-\\nquired to separate the molecules of the liquid from one another. Because the \\ntemperature does not change during vaporization, the average kinetic energy \\nof the molecules does not change.

Take the heat \\ncapacity of Hg(s) to be 28.3 J?mol–1?K–1.\\n\\nAnswer: –1.54 kJ\\n\\nIt is possible for a solid to be converted directly to a gas without passing \\nthrough the liquid phase. This process is called sublimation. The molar en-\\nthalpy of sublimation, DHsub, is the energy absorbed as heat when one mole of \\na solid is sublimed at constant pressure. Essentially all the energy put in as heat \\nin the sublimation process is used to separate the molecules in the solid from \\none another. The larger the value of DHsub, the stronger the intermolecular at-\\ntractions in the solid are.\\n\\nThe best-known example of sublimation is the conversion of dry ice, CO2(s), \\nto carbon dioxide gas according to\\n\\nCO2(s) → CO2(g)            DHsub = 25.2 kJ?mol–1\\n\\nThe name “dry ice” is used because the CO2(s) does not become a liquid at \\none atmosphere. Dry ice at one atmosphere has a temperature of –78°C and is \\nwidely used as a one-time, low-temperature refrigerant. The sublimation of 44.0 \\ngrams (one mole) of dry ice requires 25.2 kJ of heat.\\n\\nIce, H2O(s), sublimes at temperatures below its melting point (0°C).

The value of DHvap or DHsub reflects how strongly the molecules attract \\none another in the liquid or solid phase. The more strongly the molecules at-\\ntract one another, the greater the value of DHvap or DHsub.\\n\\nThe simplest force at the atomic or molecular level is that between ions. \\nWe studied this force in Chapter 6 when we discussed ionic compounds. Ions \\nwith opposite charges attract each other; ions with like charges repel each \\nother. The electrical force between ions is relatively strong; it requires a rela-\\ntively large amount of energy to separate ions of opposite charge. Therefore, \\nthe molar enthalpies of vaporization of ionic compounds are much larger \\nthan those of most nonionic compounds. Molar enthalpies of vaporization \\nof ionic compounds are typically at least 100 kJ?mol–1. The boiling points of \\nionic compounds also are higher than those of nonionic compounds. This is \\nthe reason that all ionic compounds are solids at room temperature.\\n\\nMost of the compounds listed in Table 15.3 are covalent compounds. In \\nChapter 7 we learned that some molecules have dipole moments; in other \\nwords, they are polar. An example of a polar molecule is methanal, CH2O(g), \\nbetter known by its common name, formaldehyde, whose Lewis formula is\\n\\nO\\nH\\n\\nH\\nC\\n\\nThe bond dipole moments in a formaldehyde molecule can be illustrated by\\n\\nO\\nH\\n\\nH\\nC\\n\\nbecause an oxygen atom is more electronegative than a carbon atom, which in \\nturn is more electronegative than a hydrogen atom. The net dipole moment is \\nillustrated by\\n\\nO\\nH\\n\\nH\\nC\\n\\nThus, even though a formaldehyde molecule is electrically neutral overall, it has \\na positively charged end and a negatively charged end and therefore is a polar \\nmolecule.\\n\\neXAMPLe 15-3: Recall Section 8-9 where we discussed how to use the \\nsymmetry of a molecule to predict whether or not it has a net dipole mo-\\nment. Use VSEPR theory to predict which of the following molecules has a \\nnet dipole moment:\\n  (a) SF6   (b) SF4   (c) PF5\\n\\nrecall that we define the direction \\nof a dipole moment to be from \\nthe negative charge to the positive \\ncharge, in agreement with the iuPAC \\nconvention.\\n\\n\\n\\n15. LiquiDS AnD SOLiDS528\\n\\nSolution: See margin drawings. (a) Sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, is an AX6 \\nmolecule; so it is octahedral and has no net dipole moment. (b) Sulfur \\ntetrafluoride, SF4, is an AX4E molecule; so it is seesaw-shaped and has a net \\ndipole moment. (c) Phosphorus pentafluoride, PF5, is an AX5 molecule; so \\nit is trigonal bipyramidal and has no net dipole moment.\\n\\nPrACTiCe PrObLeM 15-3: Which of the following molecules are polar?\\n(a) C2Cl4   (b) PCl3   (c) SO2   (d) CH3Cl   (e) CCl4\\n\\nAnswer: (b), (c), and (d) are polar.\\n\\nPolar molecules attract one another (Figure 15.4), and this attraction is \\ncalled dipole-dipole attraction. The charge separation in polar molecules is \\nconsiderably smaller than the full electronic charges on ions, so dipole-dipole \\nforces are weaker than ion-ion forces. Molar enthalpies of vaporization for typi-\\ncal polar compounds are around 10–20 kJ?mol–1. We must emphasize here that \\nthe interaction energies between  neutral molecules are much weaker than the \\ncovalent bonds within  molecules, which have energies of hundreds of kilojoules \\nper mole. The forces between neutral molecules are collectively referred to as \\nintermolecular forces; the prefix inter  means between. The forces within a mol-\\necule (i.e., chemical bonds) are called intramolecular forces; the prefix intra \\nmeans within.\\n\\nA particularly important dipole-dipole attraction occurs when one or more \\nhydrogen atoms in a molecule are directly bonded to a highly electronegative \\natom, as in the case of water and ammonia.

Every oxygen atom sits in the center of a tetrahedron formed by four \\nother oxygen atoms.\\n\\nThe structure of liquid water is less open than the structure of ice because, \\nwhen ice melts, the total number of hydrogen bonds decreases. Unlike most \\nother substances, the density of water increases upon going from solid to liq-\\nuid because of a partial breakdown of the hydrogen-bonded structure (that’s \\nwhy ice floats on water). The extent of hydrogen bonding in liquid water is \\nonly about 80%, whereas in ice nearly 100% of the oxygen atoms are hydrogen-\\nbonded. The extent of hydrogen bonding in water decreases as the temperature \\nincreases.\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/18 /09\\n\\n015-007 (483)\\n\\n•••\\n•••\\n\\n•••\\n\\n•••\\n\\n•••\\n•••\\n\\n•••\\n\\n•••\\n\\n•••\\n\\n•••\\n\\n•••\\n•••\\n\\n•••\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/18 /09\\n\\n015-006 (483)\\n\\nFigure 15.5 There are many hydrogen \\nbonds in liquid water; each oxygen \\natom can form two hydrogen bonds \\nbecause each oxygen atom has two lone \\npairs of electrons.

LiquiDS AnD SOLiDS530\\n\\nHydrogen bonding also occurs in liquid ammonia, NH3(l), but the indi-\\nvidual hydrogen bonds are weaker than those in water. This is because nitrogen \\nis less electronegative than oxygen and the fractional charges on the nitrogen \\nand hydrogen atoms in an ammonia molecule are less than those on the oxygen \\nand hydrogen atoms in a water molecule. Furthermore, there are fewer hydro-\\ngen bonds in NH3(l) because each nitrogen atom can form only one hydrogen \\nbond (Figure 15.7). Consequently, the value of DHvap for ammonia is only about \\nhalf that for water. Methane is a nonpolar molecule because it is tetrahedral and \\nthe four bond moments cancel. Thus, of H2O(l), NH3(l), and CH4(l); CH4(l) \\nhas the lowest value of DHvap.\\n\\nWe must consider one more attractive force. Even though methane is nonpo-\\nlar, it liquefies at 91 K and has a molar enthalpy of vaporization of 8.2 kJ?mol–1; \\ntherefore, methane molecules must attract one another. Even the noble gases, \\nwhich consist of single, spherical atoms, can be liquefied. How neutral, nonpo-\\nlar molecules attract one another was not understood until quantum theory \\nwas developed. Let’s first consider a single argon atom. As the electrons move \\nabout in the atom, there will be instants of time when the distribution of the \\ntotal charge will not be perfectly symmetric. For example, perhaps there will \\nbe more electrons on one side of the atom than on the other side, as shown in \\n Figure 15.8.

The remarkable difference \\nbetween this and the actual boiling point of water of 100.0°C is due to \\nhydrogen bonding. Were it not for hydrogen bonding, most of the water \\non earth would be gaseous and life as we know it could not exist. Moreover, \\nunlike most other substances, the density of water increases upon going \\nfrom a solid to a liquid because of a partial breakdown of its hydrogen-\\nbonded structure. Because of this ice floats on water, whereas for most \\nother substances the solid form is the more dense and sinks when placed \\ninto its liquid phase. The fact that ice floats on water causes the surfaces \\nof lakes and ponds to freeze before the bottom in winter. This surface ice \\nforms an insulating layer that allows fish and plants to survive below. Were \\nthis not the case, most rivers and ponds would freeze solid from the bottom \\nup, altering aquatic life and the food chain. These amazing properties of \\nwater that arise from hydrogen bonding are what makes finding water one \\nof the criteria used when searching for life on other planets.\\n\\n\\n\\n15-4. vAn Der WAALS FOrCeS Are ATTrACTive FOrCeS beTWeen MOLeCuLeS 531\\n\\ncharge distribution will average out, thereby yielding a perfectly symmetric dis-\\ntribution. But at any instant of time, there will be an instantaneous asymmetry \\nin the electronic charge distribution, resulting in an instantaneous dipole mo-\\nment (Figure 15.8). Now let’s consider two argon atoms separated by a small \\ndistance. The motion of the electrons in one atom influences the motion of \\nthe electrons in the other atom in such a way that the instantaneous dipole \\nmoments line up head-to-tail (Figure 15.9). This synchronized motion of the \\nelectrons leads to an effective dipole-dipole attraction that accounts for the at-\\ntractive force between atoms, nonpolar molecules, and a sizeable fraction of the \\nattractive forces between large molecules as well. This force was first explained \\nby the German physicist Fritz London and is now called a London force.\\n\\nBecause London forces are due to the motion of electrons, their strength \\ndepends on the number of electrons. The more electrons there are in the two \\ninteracting molecules, the stronger their attraction for each other. Therefore, \\nfor purely nonpolar substances, which attract each other only by way of London \\nforces, we expect the value of DHvap to increase with the number of electrons, \\nor even with the size of the molecules. The data in Table 15.4 support this pre-\\ndiction. Notice that, within each group, the value of DHvap increases with the \\nnumber of electrons.\\n\\nFigure 15.10 shows plots of the boiling points of the noble gases and the hy-\\ndrides of the nonmetallic elements. The hydrogen-bonded compounds H2O(l), \\nNH3(l), and HF(l) have unusually high boiling points. Except for the hydrogen-\\nbonded compounds, there is a general increase of boiling point with increasing \\nmolecular mass. This increase in boiling point is due to the increase in London \\nforces, which increases with the number of electrons in a molecule. In Figure \\n15.10, we see that the boiling points of the noble gases (plotted in purple) and \\nthe hydrides of Group 14 (plotted in green) are lower than those of the other \\nmolecules.

The viscosity of a liquid is a measure of its resis-\\ntance to flow. Substances that flow very slowly, such as molasses, are said to be \\nviscous. Viscosity can be measured experimentally by timing how long it takes \\na certain volume of a liquid to flow through a thin tube. Many engineering \\nprocesses involve the flow of liquids through pipes, so engineering design is \\n\\n\\n\\n15. LiquiDS AnD SOLiDS534\\n\\noften concerned with the viscosities of liquids and liquid mixtures. Viscosity \\ndecreases with increasing temperature because, as the temperature increases, \\nmolecules have greater kinetic energy and therefore can more readily overcome \\nthe intermolecular interactions. The viscosities of a variety of compounds are \\ngiven in Table 15.6.\\n\\nIf a paper clip is carefully placed on a water surface, it floats even though \\nthe density of the paper clip is greater than that of water (Figure 15.11). The \\nclip is held up by surface tension. Water striders and some other insects can \\nwalk on water, being supported by the surface tension of the water, which resists \\npenetration of the surface (Figure 15.12).\\n\\nWhat is the cause of the surface tension of a liquid? A molecule in the body \\nof a liquid is subject to attractive forces in all directions, but a molecule at the \\nsurface experiences a net attractive force toward the interior of the liquid (Fig-\\nure 15.13). Thus, molecules at the surface of a liquid experience a net inward \\nforce. This force tends to minimize the number of molecules at the surface and \\nso minimize the surface area of the liquid. This force is the surface tension. \\nAny liquid whose molecules attract one another strongly has a high surface \\ntension; water is a good example. The surface tension of a liquid tends to hold \\na drop of liquid in a spherical shape because a sphere is the shape that has the \\nsmallest surface area for a given volume (Figure 15.14). The higher the surface \\ntension is, the more nearly spherical the drop is (Figure 15.15). Table 15.6 lists \\nthe surface tension for a variety of liquids. Note that surface tension has units \\nof energy per unit area. Surface tension can be thought of as the energy that it \\ntakes to create an area of surface.\\n\\nCertain compounds, such as sodium dodecylsulfate, NaC12H25SO3(s), lower \\nthe surface tension of a liquid by concentrating at the liquid surface. Such mol-\\necules are called surfactants (surface active agents). A 0.1% sodium dodecyl-\\n\\nFigure 15.11 A metal paper clip floats \\non water because of the distribution of \\nits mass and the high surface tension of \\nthe water.

Reduction of the surface tension of water by \\nsurfactants is the basis of detergent action. In a detergent solution the surface \\ntension of the water is comparable to that of the grime (oils) on clothing, for \\nexample, thereby allowing the solution to wet the grime.\\n\\nClosely related to surface tension is capillary action, the rise of a liquid \\nin a thin tube. Capillary action occurs when the adhesive forces between the \\nmolecules of the surface of a capillary wall and the molecules of the liquid are \\nsufficiently great that the liquid adheres to, or wets, the solid surface. The ad-\\nhesive force pulls the liquid up into the capillary. The liquid column rises until \\nthe upward adhesive force is balanced by the downward gravitational force. \\nCapillary action plays a major role in the movement of water in plants, animals, \\nand soil. The water is pulled by the capillary action up into and through living \\nstructures (Figure 15.16).\\n\\nOne important consequence of surface tension and capillary action is the \\nformation of a meniscus, which is the shape formed by the surface of a liquid \\nin a capillary (Figure 15.17). For a liquid that adheres to glass (for example, wa-\\nter), the liquid rises in a glass capillary and the meniscus is concave. For a liquid \\nthat does not adhere to glass (for example, mercury), the liquid is lower where \\nit contacts the glass and the meniscus is convex.\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/19/09\\n\\n015-014 (488)\\n\\nFigure 15.13 Molecules in the interior of \\na liquid are attracted in all directions, \\nbut the molecules at the surface \\nexperience a net inward attraction that \\nminimizes the surface area of the liquid \\nand results in surface tension.\\n\\nFigure 15.14 Surface tension causes \\ndrops of liquid to assume a spherical \\nshape because a sphere is the shape \\nwith the smallest surface area for a \\ngiven volume.\\n\\nFigure 15.15  Shapes of equal volumes \\nof Hg(l), H2O(l), (CH3)2SO3(l) \\n(dimethylsulfoxide), and (CH3)2CO(l) \\n(acetone), from left to right.

LiquiDS AnD SOLiDS536\\n\\nOne final property of liquids that we shall discuss is called polarity. Gener-\\nally speaking, liquids comprised of molecules that have large dipole moments \\nform polar liquids. For example, water is a very polar solvent because individual \\nwater molecules have a large dipole moment. On the other hand, cyclohexane, \\nC6H12(l), is a nonpolar liquid because individual cyclohexane molecules have \\nno dipole moment (margin).\\n\\nWater and other polar liquids tend to be good solvents for polar species such \\nas ionic compounds. In contrast, cyclohexane and other nonpolar liquids are \\npoor solvents for ionic compounds, but tend to be good solvents for nonpolar \\nspecies, such as oils, which do not dissolve readily in water or other polar sol-\\nvents. A general rule of thumb to remember is, “like dissolves like.”\\n\\nTable 15.6 lists the relative viscosities, the surface tensions, and polarity of a \\nvariety of compounds. The most important thing to notice is the relative values \\nof these quantities.\\n\\n15-6.  A Liquid Has a unique equilibrium vapor Pressure at each \\nTemperature\\n\\nLet’s look more closely at the process of vaporization. Suppose that we cover a \\nbeaker containing a liquid with a bell jar, as shown in Figure 15.18, and main-\\ntain a constant temperature. Now suppose that we evacuate all the gas from the \\nbell jar, so that the space above the beaker and its contents is a vacuum. The \\nmolecules in the liquid are in constant motion; some at the surface will break \\naway from the liquid and form a vapor phase above it. The pressure of the vapor \\nis observed to increase rapidly at first and then progressively more slowly until a \\nconstant pressure is reached. Let’s see why.\\n\\nIn order to break free of the liquid, a molecule at the surface must have \\nenough kinetic energy to overcome the attractive force of its neighbors and be \\nmoving in the right direction.

Because the surface area is con-\\nstant, the rate of evaporation is constant (Figure 15.19). There are no molecules \\nin the vapor phase initially, so there is no condensation from the vapor phase to \\nthe liquid phase. As the concentration of molecules in the vapor phase increases, \\nthe pressure of the vapor increases and the number of vapor phase molecules \\nthat collide with the liquid surface increases. As a result, the rate of conden-\\nsation of the vapor increases. Eventually, a state is reached where the rate of \\nevaporation from the liquid surface is equal to the rate of condensation from the \\nvapor phase. The pressure of the vapor no longer increases but takes on a con-\\nstant value. The evaporation-condensation process appears to have stopped, and \\nwe say that the system is at equilibrium, meaning that no change appears to be \\ntaking place (Figure 15.20). The pressure of the vapor is now a constant value.\\n\\nThe equilibrium between the liquid and the vapor is a dynamic equilibrium; \\nthat is, the liquid continues to evaporate and the vapor continues to condense, \\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/19/09\\n\\n015-019 (490)\\n\\nEquilibrium attained\\n\\nRate of condensation of vapor\\n\\nR\\nat\\n\\ne\\n\\nRate of evaporation of liquid\\n\\nTime\\n\\nA\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/19/09\\n\\n015-020 (491)\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/19/09\\n\\n015-021 (491)\\n\\nFigure 15.20 Equilibrium is attained (at A) when the rate of evaporation of the liquid \\nequals the rate of condensation of the vapor.

The higher the temperature, the more rapidly the molecules \\nin the liquid phase move and the higher the rate of evaporation is.

LiquiDS AnD SOLiDS540\\n\\nThe vapor pressure of a liquid depends on the attractive forces between its \\nconstituent molecules. Substances with relatively strong intermolecular attrac-\\ntions will have relatively low vapor pressures. At a given temperature, relatively \\nfew of the molecules of such a substance will have sufficient kinetic energy to \\novercome the attractive forces of the other molecules and enter the vapor phase.\\n\\nThe boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure \\nequals the external pressure. The normal boiling point, the boiling point at \\nexactly one atm, of water is 100.0°C. If the external pressure is less than the one \\natm, then the temperature at which the vapor pressure of liquid water equals \\nthis pressure is less than 100.0°C. For example, the elevation at Vail, Colorado, \\nis about 2500 meters (8200 feet). The atmospheric pressure at this elevation is \\nabout 0.75 atm, so water boils at 92°C. In a pressure cooker, on the other hand, \\nwhen the pressure is 2.0 atm, water boils at 120°C. Because atmospheric pres-\\nsure decreases with increasing elevation and because the rate at which food \\ncooks depends on the temperature, it requires a significantly longer time to \\ncook food by boiling in an open container at high elevations than at sea level. \\nAn egg must be boiled for almost 5 minutes at Vail, Colorado, in order to be \\ncooked to the same extent as one boiled for 3 minutes at sea level.\\n\\n15-7.  relative Humidity is based on the vapor Pressure of Water\\n\\nThe vapor pressure of water in the atmosphere is expressed in terms of relative \\nhumidity. Relative humidity is the ratio of the partial pressure of the water va-\\npor in the atmosphere to the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at the same \\ntemperature expressed as a percentage, as given by\\n\\nPH2O—\\nP°H2O\\n� �relative humidity = × 100\\n\\n \\n(15.4)\\n\\nThe normal boiling point of a liquid \\nis the temperature at which its vapor \\npressure is equal to exactly one \\natmosphere. The normal boiling point \\nof water, for example, is 100.0°C. We \\nsaw in Chapter 13, however, that the \\npressure unit of the bar is replacing \\nthe atmosphere, so some people \\nprefer to define the normal boiling \\npoint of a liquid as the temperature \\nat which its vapor pressure is equal \\nto 1.01325 bar (which is equal to one \\natmosphere).\\n\\nwhere PH2O is the partial pressure of the water vapor in the air and PH̊2O is \\nthe equilibrium vapor pressure of water at the same temperature. At 20.0°C, the \\nequilibrium vapor pressure of water is 17.5 Torr. If the partial pressure of the \\nwater vapor in the air is 11.2 Torr, then the relative humidity is\\n\\n11.2 Torr\\n—\\n17.5 Torr� �relative humidity = × 100 = 64.0%\\n\\nIf the temperature of the air is lowered to 13.0°C, where the equilibrium \\nvapor pressure of water is 11.2 Torr, then the relative humidity is\\n\\n11.2 Torr\\n—\\n11.2 Torr� �relative humidity = × 100 = 100%\\n\\nAt 13.0°C, air that contains water vapor at a partial pressure of 11.2 Torr is \\nsaturated with water vapor. At this temperature, the water vapor begins to con-\\ndense as dew or fog, which consists of small droplets of water. The air tempera-\\nture at which the relative humidity reaches 100% is called the dew point. Most \\npeople begin to feel uncomfortable when the dew point rises above 20°C, and \\nair with a dew point above 24°C is generally regarded as extremely humid or \\nmuggy.\\n\\n\\n\\n54115-8.

A Phase Diagram Displays the regions of All the Phases  \\nof a Pure Substance Simultaneously\\n\\nThe vapor pressure curve of a pure substance can be combined with two other \\nuseful quantities, the sublimation pressure curve and the melting point curve, \\ninto a single diagram called a phase diagram. The phase diagram of water is \\nshown in Figure 15.24.\\n\\nAlong the vapor pressure curve (the red curve in Figure 15.24), liquid \\nand vapor exist together at equilibrium. To the left of this curve, at lower \\ntemperatures, the water exists as a liquid. To the right of this curve, at higher \\ntemperatures, the water exists as a vapor. The equilibrium vapor pressure of \\na liquid increases with temperature up to the critical point (Figure 15.24), \\nwhere the vapor pressure curve terminates abruptly. Above the critical tem-\\nperature, the gas and the liquid phases become indistinguishable. A gas \\nabove its critical temperature cannot be liquefied no matter how high a pres-\\nsure is applied. The critical point for water occurs at 218 atm (221 bar) and \\n647 K. Water vapor above 647 K cannot be liquefied by the application of \\npressure.\\n\\nAlong the sublimation pressure curve (gray curve in Figure 15.24), solid \\nand vapor exist together at equilibrium. To the left of this curve, at lower tem-\\nperatures, water exists as a solid (ice). To the right of this curve, at higher tem-\\nperatures, water exists as a vapor.\\n\\nAlong the melting point curve (blue curve in Figure 15.24), solid and liquid \\nexist together in equilibrium. To the left of this curve, water exists as a solid, \\nand to the right of this curve, water exists as a liquid. The melting point at a \\npressure of exactly one atm is called the normal melting point or the normal \\nfreezing point. However, melting points are only weakly dependent on pressure, \\nso a melting point curve is an almost vertical line (Figure 15.24). For almost all \\n\\n\\n\\n15. LiquiDS AnD SOLiDS542\\n\\nsubstances, the melting point increases with increasing pressure at a rate of 0.01 \\nto 0.03 K?atm–1. Water is anomalous because its melting point decreases with \\nincreasing pressure. The melting point of ice decreases by about 0.01 K?atm–1 of \\napplied pressure. Consequently, unlike most other solids, ice can be melted by \\nthe application of pressure. We discuss why this is so in Section 19-7.\\n\\nNotice that the three curves in Figure 15.24 separate regions in which water \\nexists as a solid, a liquid, or a vapor. Let’s use Figure 15.24 to follow the behavior \\nof water as it is heated from –50.0°C to 200.0°C at a constant pressure of one \\natm. At –50.0°C (223.2 K) and one atm, water exists as ice. As we heat the ice \\nat one atm, we move horizontally from left to right along the dashed line in  \\nFigure 15.24. At 0°C (273.2 K), we cross the melting point curve and pass from \\nthe solid region into the liquid region. At 100.0°C (373.2 K), we cross the equi-\\nlibrium vapor pressure curve and pass from the liquid region into the vapor \\nregion.\\n\\nThe three curves in Figure 15.24 intersect at a point called the triple point. \\nAt the triple point, and only at the triple point, all three phases—solid, liquid, \\nand gas—coexist in equilibrium. The triple point for water occurs at 4.58 Torr \\n(0.0060 atm) and 273.16 K. Notice that if we heat ice at a constant pressure less \\nthan 4.58 Torr, then the ice sublimes rather than melts. The sublimation of \\nwater is used in the process of “freeze-drying.”\\n\\nP\\n/a\\n\\ntm\\n\\nP\\n/b\\n\\nar\\n\\nT/K\\n\\n218 221\\n\\n1.00 1.01\\n\\n≈\\n\\n≈\\n\\n≈\\n\\n≈\\n\\n≈\\n\\n0.0060 0.0061\\n\\n273.16 373.15 647\\n\\nCritical point\\n\\nLiquid waterSolid\\nwater\\n(ice)\\n\\nTriple\\npoint\\n\\nNormal freezing\\npoint\\n\\nWater vapor\\n\\nNormal boiling\\npoint\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n07/03/09\\n\\n015-025 (495)\\n\\nFigure 15.24 The phase diagram of water (not to scale; see the breaks in both the \\nhorizontal and vertical axes), displays simultaneously the sublimation pressure curve \\n(gray), the vapor pressure curve (red), and the melting point curve (blue).

Instead, CO2(s) sublimes. \\nThe normal sublimation point of CO2 is 195 K (–78°C), which is the tempera-\\nture of solid CO2(s) at one atm. Liquid CO2(l) can be obtained by compressing \\nCO2(g) at a temperature below its critical point of 304 K (31°C). A pressure of \\nabout 60 atm is required to liquefy CO2(g) at 25°C. A carbon dioxide–filled fire \\nextinguisher at 25°C contains CO2(l) at a pressure of about 60 atm.\\n\\n15-9.  X-ray Diffraction Patterns yield information  \\nAbout the Structures of Crystalline Solids\\n\\nIn the remaining sections of this chapter, we shall discuss solids. Solid-state \\nchemistry has profoundly affected the world we live in through the creation \\nand use of semiconductors, transistors, computer chips, and many other solid-\\nstate devices. Solids can be classified into crystalline and noncrystalline solids. \\nWe discuss crystalline solids first and then briefly discuss amorphous solids and \\nliquid crystals.\\n\\nA distinguishing characteristic of crystalline solids is the ordered nature of \\nthe molecules or ions in the solid state, an arrangement we refer to as a crystal \\nlattice. We can actually obtain a “picture” of a crystal lattice by passing X-rays \\nthrough the crystal. The presence of a definite ordered array of atoms in the \\ncrystal produces a characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern that can be recorded \\nas an array of spots (Figure 15.26).\\n\\nTo get a feel for the origin of X-ray diffraction patterns from crystals, let’s \\nexamine the optical diffraction patterns formed by light passing through tiny \\nholes in an opaque sheet (Figure 15.27). The size and arrangement of the holes  \\nyield a particular diffraction pattern that can be used to determine the ar-\\nrangement of the holes that produced it. Just as the optical diffraction pat-\\nterns carry information regarding the relative positions and the spacings of the \\nholes, X-ray diffraction patterns provide information about the arrangement of \\nthe atoms in crystals (sidebox).\\n\\nThe smallest subunit of a crystal lattice that can be used to generate the \\nentire lattice is called a unit cell. A crystal lattice is thus a repeating pattern \\nof unit cells. Figure 15.28 illustrates in two dimensions how a unit cell can \\ngenerate a crystal lattice. There are a variety of three-dimensional unit cells \\nthat differ in their shapes, but, for simplicity, we shall discuss only cubic unit \\ncells because most metallic elements have one of three kinds of cubic unit cells \\n(Figure 15.29).\\n\\nThe simple cubic unit cell has atoms only at the vertices of the cube, and \\neach one of these atoms is shared by a total of eight unit cells. Because each of \\nthe eight atoms of a simple cubic unit cell is shared by a total of eight unit cells, \\nwe can assign one atom to a simple cubic unit cell. Only one metal, polonium, \\noccurs as a simple cubic lattice. A body-centered cubic unit cell is similar to \\na simple cubic unit cell, except that there is an atom at the center of the unit \\ncell. This atom is shared by no other unit cells, so we can assign a total of two \\natoms to a body-centered unit cell. Some metals that occur as a body-centered \\ncubic lattice are barium, cesium, potassium, lithium, molybdenum, tantalum, \\n\\nFigure 15.26 The X-ray diffraction \\npattern produced by a crystal of sodium \\nchloride.

LiquiDS AnD SOLiDS546\\n\\nX-rAy DiFFrACTiOn X-ray diffraction is a powerful analytical method for \\ndetermining molecular structure. X-rays are a penetrating form of radiation, \\nproviding information about the bulk structure of solids, not just the surface. \\nFor example, X-rays can be used to check the integrity of steel beams inside of \\nwalls following an earthquake or to look for stress fractures in airplane wings. \\nX-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths from 10–8 to 10–11 meters. \\nBecause the wavelength of X-rays is comparable to the size of atoms (about \\n10–10 meters), they are ideally suited for probing the structural arrangement of \\natoms and molecules in various materials. The presence of a definite ordered \\narray of atoms in a crystal produces a characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern. \\nThe electron density contour map of benzoic acid is shown below.\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/20/09\\n\\n015-in text C (504)\\n\\n   Lewis formula of benzoic acid\\n\\nH H\\n\\nH H\\n\\nC C\\n\\nC C\\n\\nC C C\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nThe general outline of the planar molecule is clearly discernible. The character-\\nistic shape of a benzene ring is also evident. Such information is typical of that \\nobtainable with X-ray diffraction techniques. X-ray diffraction patterns provide \\ninformation about the spatial arrangement of atoms in crystals and allow us to \\ndetermine the structure of various compounds, metals, and even large biomol-\\necules. The first person to apply X-ray diffraction to proteins was Nobel laure-\\nate Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin (Frontispiece). Since her pioneering work in the \\n1930s, the structures of hundreds of proteins have been determined by X-ray \\ndiffraction methods. The image below shows the results obtained for a crystal of \\ninsulin. The famous double-helical structure of DNA was determined by Watson \\nand Crick using X-ray diffraction data obtained by Rosalind Franklin.

If \\nn is the number of atoms in a unit cell (1 for a simple cubic lattice, 2 for a body-\\ncentered cubic lattice, and 4 for a face-centered cubic lattice), then Vunit cell/n \\nis the cubic volume element around\\teach\\tatom in the crystal.

Crystals Can be Classified According to the Forces  \\nbetween the Constituent Particles\\n\\nCrystal structures are determined by the size of the atoms, ions, or molecules \\nmaking up the lattice and by the nature of the forces that act between these \\nparticles. The examples that we discussed in the previous section consisted of \\nparticles of the same size. Such crystals are called atomic crystals, a good ex-\\nample being crystals of the noble gases, which crystallize as face-centered cubic \\ncrystals. In this section we discuss the properties of some other kinds of crystals.\\n\\nAs discussed in Chapter 6, ionic crystals are held together by the electro-\\nstatic attraction between ions of opposite charge. The crystalline structure of \\nionic crystals depends on how the cations and anions can be packed together \\nto form a lattice. Consequently, the difference in the sizes of the cation and the \\nanion plays a key role. For example, the unit cells of the salts sodium chloride \\nand cesium chloride are shown in Figure 15.30. Notice that the chloride ions in  \\nsodium chloride form a face-centered cubic lattice, while the chloride ions  \\nin cesium chloride form a simple cubic lattice. Also notice that each sodium ion \\nin NaCl(s) is surrounded by an octahedral arrangement of six larger chloride \\nions, while each cesium ion in CsCl(s) is surrounded by a cubic arrangement of \\nfour larger chloride ions. The different packing arrangements for NaCl(s) and \\nCsCl(s) are a direct consequence of the fact that cesium ions are larger than \\nsodium ions.\\n\\nEach ion in an ionic crystal is surrounded by ions of opposite charge. The \\ntotal electrostatic interaction energy of the lattice accounts for much of the \\nlattice energy (Section 6-7). Because electrostatic interactions are relatively \\nstrong, ionic solids usually have high melting points and low vapor pressures.\\n\\nCrystals composed of neutral molecules are called molecular crystals. We \\ndiscussed the forces that hold the molecules together in molecular crystals in Sec-\\ntion 15-4. These forces include both dipole-dipole and London forces. Because \\nthese forces tend to be weaker than those between ions, molecular crystals gen-\\nerally have lower melting points and higher vapor pressures than ionic crystals.\\n\\n\\n\\n15. LiquiDS AnD SOLiDS552\\n\\nMolecular crystals come in a great variety of types. For example, methane \\ncrystallizes in a face-centered cubic structure; carbon dioxide crystals have \\nthe unit cell shown in Figure 15.31. Large biological molecules such as pro-\\nteins and DNA also form molecular crystals (sidebox, page 546).\\n\\nA few substances form covalent network crystals, in which the constituent \\nparticles are held together by covalent bonds. Diamond and graphite, two forms \\nof carbon, are good examples of such substances (see also Interchapter M). \\nDiamond has an extended, covalently bonded tetrahedral structure. Each car-\\nbon atom lies at the center of a tetrahedron formed by four other carbon atoms \\n(Figure 15.32). The carbon-carbon bond distance is 154 pm, which is the same \\nas the carbon-carbon bond distance in ethane. The diamond crystal is, in ef-\\nfect, a gigantic molecule. The hardness of diamond is due to the fact that each \\ncarbon atom throughout the crystal is covalently bonded to four others; thus, \\nmany strong covalent bonds must be broken in order to cleave a diamond. \\n\\nGraphite has the unusual layered structure shown in Figure 15.33. The car-\\nbon-carbon bond distance within a layer is 139 pm, which is close to the carbon-\\ncarbon bond distance in benzene. The distance between layers is about 340 pm. \\nThe bonding within a layer is covalent, but the interaction between layers is \\nweak. Therefore, the layers easily slip past one another, thereby producing the \\nmolecular basis for the lubricating action of graphite. The “lead” in lead pencils \\nis actually graphite. Layers of the graphite slide from the pencil onto the paper. \\nGraphite is also used as a solid lubricant in many high-temperature applications \\nwhere oils would be unsuitable.\\n\\nNot all solids are crystalline. When liquids of high viscosity are cooled rap-\\nidly, a rigid structure forms before the molecules have time to orient properly to \\nform a crystalline lattice. The molecules of these materials lack the high degree \\nof spatial order of crystalline substances and have more of a “frozen-in” liquid \\nstructure. Such materials are called amorphous solids.

LiquiDS AnD SOLiDS554\\n\\n15-11.  The electrons in Metals Are Delocalized  \\nThroughout the Crystal\\n\\nThe high electrical conductivity of metals is one of their most characteristic \\nproperties. To see why a metal has a high electrical conductivity and an insula-\\ntor has a low electrical conductivity, we must discuss the electronic energy levels \\nin atomic crystals.\\n\\nLet’s see how we might form a crystal of metallic sodium. Imagine that we \\nbring Avogadro’s number of widely separated sodium atoms to their positions \\nin the crystalline lattice. We learned in Chapter 9 that when we bring two hydro-\\ngen atoms together, their 1s orbitals combine to form two molecular orbitals, \\na bonding orbital and an antibonding orbital (Figure 15.35a). When we form \\na sodium crystal from its constituent atoms, we bring Avogadro’s number of \\nsodium atoms together. Because a sodium atom has a neonlike electronic core \\nand an outer 3s orbital, it’s the 3s orbitals of the sodium atoms that combine to \\nform molecular orbitals. In this case, however, the resultant molecular orbitals \\nare delocalized over the entire crystalline lattice. Furthermore, because we are \\nbringing Avogadro’s number of sodium atoms together, we get Avogadro’s num-\\nber of these delocalized molecular orbitals. The energies of these orbitals are \\nso close to one another that they essentially form a continuum of energy levels, \\nfrom the bonding orbital of lowest energy to the antibonding orbital of highest \\nenergy, as depicted in Figure 15.35b. Thus, we picture a metallic crystal as a lat-\\ntice occupied by ions that result from having the valence electrons of its atoms \\noccupy orbitals that are delocalized over the entire crystal lattice.\\n\\nBecause a sodium atom has a neonlike core with a single unpaired outer 3s\\nelectron, only one-half of the delocalized orbitals of the crystalline lattice are oc-\\ncupied by the valence electrons of the sodium atoms. Of the remaining unfilled \\norbitals, many are so close in energy to the filled orbitals (valence orbitals) that \\nrelatively little energy is required to excite some electrons into the unfilled orbit-\\nals. Because these excited electrons are unpaired and the orbitals they occupy \\nare only partially filled, these electrons are easily displaced by an applied electric \\nfield, a property accounting for the high electrical conductivity of the metal.\\n\\nNow let’s consider an insulator, such as diamond (carbon). Its extended co-\\nvalent network can be described in terms of sp3 hybrid orbitals on each carbon \\natom. Again, imagine bringing Avogadro’s number of carbon atoms together. \\n\\n3s3s3s3s1s 1s\\n\\nAvogadro’s\\nnumber\\n\\n3s3s3s3s\\n\\nAvogadro’s\\nnumber\\n\\n(a) (b)\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n07/06 /09\\n\\n015-038\\n\\n05/27/10\\n\\nFigure 15.35  (a) When two hydrogen atoms are brought together, their 1s orbitals \\ncombine to form a bonding and an antibonding molecular orbital. (b) When \\nAvogadro’s number of sodium atoms are brought together to form a sodium crystal, \\nthe 3s orbitals (the valence orbitals) of the sodium atoms combine to form Avogadro’s \\nnumber of molecular orbitals that are delocalized over the entire crystal lattice. The \\nenergies of these orbitals are so close together that they form essentially a continuum  \\nof energy levels, as illustrated schematically here.\\n\\n\\n\\n15-12. LiquiD CrySTALS Are SeMiFLuiD ArrAngeMenTS OF MOLeCuLeS 555\\n\\nIn this case, however, there is a relatively large gap in energy between the band \\nof delocalized bonding orbitals (called the valence band) and the band of delo-\\ncalized antibonding orbitals (called the conduction band) (Figure 15.36). The \\nvalence electrons of the carbon atoms occupy only the valence band, and the \\nconduction band is empty. Furthermore, the energy of the gap between the two \\nbands (called the band gap) is so large that the electrons in the valence band \\nare not easily promoted into the conduction band. Consequently, no electrons \\nare available to conduct an electric current, so diamond is an insulator. In con-\\ntrast, in a good conductor, such as sodium metal, there is no gap between the \\nenergies of the bonding orbitals and the antibonding orbitals; in other words, \\nthe band gap is zero in a good conductor.\\n\\nSome substances, such as silicon and germanium, have relatively small band \\ngaps. These substances have properties that are intermediate between conductors \\nand insulators; therefore, they are called semiconductors. Semiconductors are \\nthe basis for transistors, computer chips, and many other electronic devices (see \\nInterchapter M). Figure 15.37 summarizes the band structure of metals, semicon-\\nductors, and insulators. As the temperature of a semiconductor is increased, more \\nelectrons acquire sufficient energy to be promoted from the valence band to the \\nconduction band, so the electrical conductivity of semiconductors increases with \\nincreasing temperature. This temperature dependence is the opposite of that of \\nmetals, whose electrical conductivity decreases with increasing temperature.\\n\\n15-12.

Liquid crystals \\nwith this structure are called cholesteric. These oriented layers in the liquid \\ncrystal strongly diffract light with a wavelength comparable to the distance \\nbetween repeating layers. Because this distance is very sensitive to tempera-\\nture, the wavelength of the diffracted light, and consequentially the perceived \\n“color” of the crystal, changes with temperature. This effect is used to make \\ndevices such as liquid crystal thermometers and temperature-sensitive paints.\\n\\nBecause the orientation of the molecules in some liquid crystals is sensitive \\nto electric fields, these crystals can be used to produce liquid crystal displays, \\nor LCDs, for handheld electronics, computer monitors, and televisions. When \\nan electric field is applied, the liquid crystal is aligned in such a way as to alter \\nthe ability of light to pass through the device. \\n\\n15-13.  Colloidal Dispersions Do not Separate upon Standing\\n\\nAs we saw in Chapter 12, in a solution, the solute particles are dispersed as indi-\\nvidual ions or molecules. A solution is homogeneous at the molecular level. At \\nthe other extreme we have what is called a suspension. In a suspension the dis-\\npersed particles are large enough to be seen with the naked eye, or at least un-\\nder a microscope. A solution will remain homogeneous indefinitely, but the dis-\\npersed particles of a suspension will eventually settle out upon standing. There \\nis an interesting and important case between these two extremes in which the \\nparticles are much larger than individual small molecules but are too small to \\nbe seen even with a microscope. These systems are called colloidal dispersions \\nor sometimes just colloids. Although not an “official” state of matter like a solid \\nor a liquid, colloidal dispersions have special properties that depend upon the \\nsize of the constituent particles.\\n\\nThe distinction between a solution, a colloidal dispersion, and a suspen-\\nsion is not rigid because it depends upon the size of the dispersed particles, \\nbut it is generally accepted that particles of colloidal dispersions are about \\n1 nm to 1000 nm in size. This figure is actually comparable to the sizes of mac-\\nromolecules such as starches and proteins, and solutions of these molecules \\nexhibit colloidal behavior even though the dispersed particles are individual \\nmolecules.\\n\\nA common type of colloidal dispersion consists of solid colloidal particles \\ndispersed in a liquid. Figure 15.41 shows a colloidal dispersion of gold in water. \\nThe dispersion is red because the size of the gold particles is such that they scat-\\nter red light, which is captured by the eye. This is but one example of how the \\nproperties of colloidal systems differ from a true solution.\\n\\nThe properties of colloidal dispersions are due to the fact that the dispersed \\nparticles have a very large surface area. For example, the surface area of a cube \\nthat is one centimeter on a side is 6 × 10–4 m2, but if the cube is subdivided into \\ncubes that are 10–8 meters on a side (which is a typical size for colloids), then \\nthe surface area of all the little cubes is 600 m2; the area is increased by a mil-\\nlionfold (Figure 15.42).\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n07/06/09\\n\\n015-043\\n\\nFigure 15.40 In one type of liquid \\ncrystal, called cholesteric, the \\nmolecules are arranged in layers \\nwith different orientations, forming \\na helical structure that repeats over a \\nfixed distance.

LiquiDS AnD SOLiDS558\\n\\nBefore we discuss other types of colloidal dispersions, we must introduce \\ntwo terms. The particles that are dispersed are called the dispersed phase \\nand the medium in which they are dispersed is called the dispersion medium. \\nThus, in the case of the colloidal gold-water system in Figure 15.41, gold is the \\ndispersed phase and water is the dispersion medium. This type of colloidal \\ndispersion is called a sol. Milk is a colloidal dispersion of a liquid in a liquid \\nand is called an emulsion. Smoke is a colloidal dispersion of a solid in a gas, \\nand is called an aerosol. Aerosols play an important role in atmospheric chem-\\nistry and meteorology. Various other types of colloidal dispersions are given in \\nTable 15.9. Notice that all the combinations of a solid, a liquid, and a gas can \\nform a colloidal dispersion except for a gas and a gas. A mixture of two gases \\nalways forms a true solution. In this section we shall be mainly concerned with \\nsols and emulsions.\\n\\nColloidal dispersions can be prepared in a number of ways. Some disper-\\nsions are easy to prepare. For example, a colloidal dispersion of starch in water \\ncan be prepared by simply adding starch to water. The colloidal gold sol shown \\nin Figure 15.41, on the other hand, is more difficult to prepare. The reaction of \\ngold(III) chloride with formaldehyde, CH2O(l), and water produces colloidal \\ngold according to\\n\\n2 AuCl3(aq) + 3 H2O(l) + 3 CH2O(aq) → \\n 2 Au(colloidal) + 3 HCOOH(aq) + 6 HCl(aq)\\n\\nThe concentrations of the reactants and the temperature must be care-\\nfully controlled to avoid the growth of the gold particles and their subsequent \\nprecipitation. Other sols, for example, those of various metallic oxides and \\nhydroxides, can be prepared in a similar manner. For instance, pouring a so-\\nlution of FeCl3(aq) into a beaker of boiling water produces a deep red sol of \\nFe(OH)3(colloidal) according to\\n\\nFeCl3(aq) + 3 H2O(l) → Fe(OH)3(colloidal) + 3 HCl(aq)\\n\\nFigure 15.42  A cube with an \\nedge length of one centimeter  \\n(or 10–2 m) has a surface area \\nof (6)(10–2 m)2 = 6 × 10–4 m2. \\nIf the cube is subdivided into 1018 \\nsmaller cubes, each with an edge \\nlength of 10–8 meters, the total \\nsurface area of all the smaller cubes \\nis (1018)(6)(10–8 m)2 = 600 m2.\\n\\n10–2 m\\n(1 cm)\\n\\n10–8 m\\n(10–6 cm)\\n\\nSurface area = 6 × 10–4 m2 Surface of each cube = 6 × 10–16 m2\\n\\n(not to scale)\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n07/07 /09\\n\\n015-046\\n\\n\\n\\n15-13.

Emul-\\nsions are generally unstable unless a third substance, called an emulsifying \\nagent, is added. Soaps and detergents act as emulsifying agents for oil-water \\nemulsions. The molecules of soaps and detergents consist of a long hydrocar-\\nbon chain with a polar group, such as a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid group \\n(margin). These molecules can be represented schematically as\\n\\nnonpolar\\nhydrocarbon\\n\\nportion\\n\\npolar\\ngroup\\n\\n–\\n\\nThe hydrocarbon ends of these molecules dissolve in the oil droplets (remem-\\nber that “like dissolves like”) and the polar ends stick out of the droplets and \\ndissolve in the water. The resulting particles are called  micelles (Figure 15.43). \\nMicelles stabilize the oil-water emulsion because the acid groups sticking out of \\nthe surfaces of the micelles dissociate, giving the surface a net negative charge, \\nwhich repels other micelles.\\n\\nOne characterization of a colloidal solution is that it will scatter a beam of \\nlight. This effect was first characterized by the Irish natural philosopher John \\nTyndall and is known as the Tyndall effect (Figure 15.44). This is the same ef-\\n\\nFigure 15.43 A schematic illustration of \\na micelle. Micelles contain emulsifying \\nagents such as organic acids with \\nlong hydrocarbon chains. A micelle is \\nformed when the hydrocarbon ends \\nof these organic acids dissolve in a \\ndroplet of an oil-like substance, leaving \\nthe polar, acidic ends of the molecules \\nsticking out into the solvent (usually \\nwater). The acidic groups dissociate \\nand impart a net negative charge on \\nthe surface of the micelle. This charge \\nhelps to stabilize the micelles by \\nhindering them from coming together \\nand forming aggregates.\\n\\n+\\n\\n––\\n\\n–\\n–\\n\\n– –\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n––\\n\\n–\\n\\n– –\\n\\n–\\n–\\n\\n– –\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\nGrease\\n\\nA completely formed micelle\\n\\n+ +\\n+\\n\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n\\n+\\n+\\n\\n+++\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n+\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n\\n+\\n+ +\\n\\n+\\n\\nDispersion medium Dispersed phase Name of system Examples\\n\\n gas liquid liquid aerosol fog, mist, clouds\\n\\n gas solid solid aerosol dust, smoke\\n\\n liquid gas foam  whipped cream, \\nshaving cream\\n\\n liquid liquid emulsion  water-based paints, \\nmilk, mayonnaise, \\ndetergents\\n\\n liquid solid sol  gold in water, \\noil-based paint \\npigments, ink, blood, \\nclay\\n\\n solid gas solid foam  pumice stone, \\nstyrofoam, aerogel\\n\\n solid liquid gel  opal, cheese, gelatin, \\njelly\\n\\n solid solid solid sol  ruby glass, some \\ncolored gemstones\\n\\nTAbLe 15.9 Types of colloidal dispersions\\n\\nO HC\\n\\nO\\n\\ncarboxylic acid\\ngroup\\n\\nO HS\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nsulfonic acid\\ngroup\\n\\n\\n\\n15.

A nice, \\nsimple demonstration of the Tyndall effect is to mix a single drop of milk into a \\nliter of water. Shining a flashlight or a laser pointer through the liquid dramati-\\ncally shows the scattering due to the resulting colloid.\\n\\nAn interesting example of a colloid is aerogel, that was recently used to cap-\\nture dust from the comet Wild 2 in 2004 in NASA’s Stardust mission. Aerogel is \\na silicon-based colloidal solid with a porous spongelike structure that is 99.8% \\nempty space and 1000 times less dense than glass. Particles of comet dust the \\nsize of a grain of sand and traveling at speeds up to six times that of a rifle bullet \\nwere slowed and captured in aerogel, which was then transported back to earth \\nfor study. The first samples arrived successfully in early 2006, still intact in the \\nblue-tinged aerogel they were collected in (Figure 15.45).\\n\\nSuMMAry\\nAll molecules attract one another, but the molecular interactions are much \\ngreater in solids and liquids than in gases. The quantities DHvap and DHfus are \\nmeasures of the strength of these interactions in liquids and in solids, respec-\\ntively. The attractions between covalently bonded molecules are collectively \\ncalled van der Waals forces. Two nonpolar molecules attract each other because \\ntheir electrons redistribute such that the instantaneous dipole moments on \\neach molecule are head-to-tail; the resulting attraction is called a London force. \\nIf the molecules are polar, then in addition to the London forces, they also at-\\ntract each other by dipole-dipole forces. The polar molecules orient themselves \\nso that their dipole moments are head-to-tail; this orientation minimizes their \\nenergy. When a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to a highly electronegative \\nspecies such as an oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine atom within a molecule, a par-\\nticularly strong intermolecular force called hydrogen bonding results. Hydro-\\ngen bonding is responsible for many of the unique properties of water.\\n\\nPure liquids have a unique equilibrium vapor pressure at each temperature. \\nThis vapor pressure increases with increasing temperature until it equals the \\nexternal pressure, at which point the liquid boils. The normal boiling point of \\na liquid is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to \\none atmosphere.\\n\\nThe various phases of a pure substance can be displayed simultaneously on \\na phase diagram. The normal melting point is the temperature at which the \\npure solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium at one atmosphere. The normal \\nboiling point is the temperature at which the pure liquid and gas phases are \\nin equilibrium at one atmosphere. The triple point is the only point at which \\nthe solid, liquid, and gas phases are simultaneously in equilibrium. The critical \\npoint is the temperature above which a gas cannot be liquefied by the applica-\\ntion of pressure.\\n\\nThe structure of a crystalline solid can be determined from the diffraction \\npattern of X-rays passed through the crystal. A unit cell is the smallest subunit \\nof a crystal lattice that can be used to generate the entire lattice. There are a \\nvariety of different unit cells observed in crystalline solids. The three cubic ones \\nare the simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic unit cells. \\nCrystals can be classified according to the type of forces between the constitu-\\nent particles. Important types of crystals are atomic crystals, ionic crystals, mo-\\nlecular crystals, covalent network crystals, and metallic crystals. Metals are good \\n\\nFigure 15.44  An illustration of the \\nTyndall effect.

The properties of liquid crystals \\nallow them to be used to construct devices that change color with temperature \\nand to make the displays used on various electronic devices. Colloidal disper-\\nsions are heterogeneous mixtures that, unlike a suspension, do not separate \\ninto two distinct components upon standing. The particles in a colloidal disper-\\nsion are typically 1 nm to 1000 nm in size and can scatter light. All combina-\\ntions of a solid, a liquid, and a gas can form a colloidal dispersion except for a \\ngas and a gas.\\n\\ntranslational motion   519\\nheating curve   521\\nmolar enthalpy of fusion, \\n\\nDHfus   522\\nmolar enthalpy of vaporization, \\n\\nDHvap   522\\nsublimation   526\\nmolar enthalpy of sublimation, \\n\\nDHsub   526\\ndipole-dipole attraction   528\\nintermolecular forces   528\\nintramolecular forces   528\\nhydrogen bond   528\\nLondon force   531\\nvan der Waals forces   532\\nviscosity   533\\nsurface tension   534\\nsurfactant   534\\ncapillary action   535\\nmeniscus   535\\npolarity   536\\nequilibrium   537\\ndynamic equilibrium   537\\nequilibrium vapor pressure   538\\n\\nvapor pressure curve   538\\nnormal boiling point   540\\nrelative humidity   540\\ndew point   540\\nphase diagram   541\\ncritical point   541\\ncritical temperature   541\\nsublimation pressure curve   541\\nmelting point curve   541\\nnormal melting point   541\\nnormal freezing point   541\\ntriple point   542\\nnormal sublimation point   545\\ncrystal lattice   545\\nX-ray diffraction pattern   545\\noptical diffraction pattern   545\\nunit cell   545\\nsimple cubic unit cell   545\\nbody-centered cubic unit \\n\\ncell   545\\nface-centered cubic unit cell   547\\ncrystallographic radius   548\\natomic crystal   551\\nionic crystal   551\\n\\nmolecular crystal   551\\ncovalent network crystal   552\\namorphous solid   552\\nmetallic crystal   554\\nvalence band   555\\nconduction band   555\\nband gap   555\\nsemiconductor   555\\nsmectic phase   556\\nnematic phase   556\\nliquid crystal   557\\ncholesteric   557\\nliquid crystal display (LCD)   557\\nsuspension   557\\ncolloidal dispersion   557\\ncolloid   557\\ndispersed phase   558\\ndispersion medium   558\\nsol   558\\nemulsion   558\\naerosol   558\\nmicelle   559\\nTyndall effect   559\\n\\n qP = nCP(T2 – T1) (15.1)  (energy as heat required to change the temperature of n moles of a \\nsubstance from T1 to T2)\\n\\n qfus = nDHfus (15.2)  (energy as heat required to melt n moles of a substance)\\n\\n qvap = nDHvap (15.3)  (energy as heat required to vaporize n moles of a substance)\\n\\nequATiOnS yOu SHOuLD knOW HOW TO uSe\\n\\nTerMS yOu SHOuLD knOW\\n\\n\\n\\n15.

He had hoped to pursue a \\ncareer in chemistry, but his parents persuaded him to study engineering \\nbecause they believed that the prospects for pure research in chemistry \\nwere poor. Nonetheless, he later studied chemistry at several universities \\nand finally completed a doctorate at the University of Utrecht in 1874. \\nIn the same year, he published a paper using a tetrahedral model of the \\ncarbon atom to explain the structural properties of organic molecules \\nand optical isomerization. However, he did not present this as his \\nthesis for his doctorate because he feared that it was too controversial \\nto be accepted. This work was strongly attacked by some prominent \\norganic chemists, but eventually the model of the tetrahedral carbon \\natom became the foundation of modern organic structural chemistry. \\nBecause it was difficult to find a university position, van’t Hoff first \\ngave private lessons and then found a position in 1876 as a physics \\nlecturer at the Royal Veterinary School in Utrecht. The next year he \\nreceived an appointment at the University of Amersterdam, where he \\nremained for 18 years. He eventually left for a research professorship \\nat the University of Berlin, where they built a new laboratory for him. \\nWorking with Svante Arrhenius (Chapter 6 Frontispiece), he studied \\nthe dissociation of ionic substances in solution. He later turned his \\nattention to investigating the rates of chemical reactions and chemical \\nequilibrium. In 1887, Wilhelm Ostwald and van’t Hoff founded Zeitschrift \\nfur Physikalische Chemie, the first journal devoted to physical chemistry. \\nVan’t Hoff was awarded the first-ever Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1901 \\n“for his discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure \\nin solutions.”\\n\\n\\n\\n569\\n\\n16.

Why does the same antifreeze added to the coolant water in a car radiator prevent both overheating in summer and \\nfreezing in winter? What factors operate to keep biological cells from collaps-\\ning? Why do divers get the bends when they ascend too quickly to the water’s \\nsurface? These and many other questions can be answered when the properties \\nof solutions are understood from a molecular point of view. The major empha-\\nsis of this chapter is on the colligative properties of solutions. Colligative prop-\\nerties depend primarily on the ratio of the number of solute particles to the \\nnumber of solvent particles in the solution rather than on the chemical nature \\nof the solute. The colligative properties of solutions are vapor pressure lower-\\ning, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure.\\n\\nWe showed in Chapter 15 that pure water has a unique equilibrium vapor \\npressure at each temperature. We show in this chapter that the equilibrium \\nvapor pressure of pure water, or any other solvent, decreases when a nonvolatile \\nsubstance is dissolved in it. The vapor pressure–lowering effect is the key to \\nunderstanding the colligative properties of solutions.\\n\\n16-1. Solutes Affect the Properties of the Solvent\\nRecall from Chapter 12 that when a solute is dissolved in a solvent, the solution \\nformed usually is homogeneous throughout, right down to the molecular level. \\nWe also noted there that solute molecules or ions interact with solvent mol-\\necules. The electrostatic interactions between dissolved ions and polar solvent \\nmolecules are especially strong. As a result, ions (especially cations) become \\nsolvated in the solution, that is, attached to solvent molecules (see Figure 12.2). \\nBecause water molecules are polar, water is a good solvent for a wide variety of \\nelectrolytes (e.g., sodium chloride and magnesium sulfate) and polar nonelec-\\ntrolytes (e.g., sucrose and ethanol).\\n\\nThe strong interactions between solute particles (molecules or ions) and \\nsolvent molecules dramatically affect many of the properties of the solvent. \\nSuch properties, called colligative properties, depend primarily on the ratio of \\nthe number of solute particles to the number of solvent molecules in a solution. \\nConsequently, it is important to understand the different ways in which this \\n\\n\\n\\n16. ColligAtive ProPertieS of SolutionS570\\n\\nratio is described. The four commonly used measures of solute concentration \\nare molarity (denoted by M), percentage by mass (denoted by % mass), mole \\nfraction (denoted by x), and molality (denoted by m). We shall define each of \\nthese measures in turn below.\\n\\nWe are already familiar with the concentration unit molarity (Section 12-2). \\nMolarity is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. Molarity \\nis the most widely used measure of solute concentration because it is the easiest \\nto use. We need only weigh out the appropriate amount of solute, place it in the \\nappropriate volumetric flask, add solvent to dissolve the solute, and dilute up to \\nthe volume mark; making certain by swirling that the solution is homogeneous \\n(Figure 12.4). However, molarity has a disadvantage as a measure of concentra-\\ntion in that the molarity of a given solution changes as the temperature changes \\nbecause the volume of the solution changes as the temperature changes. Usually, \\nthe volume of the solution increases as the temperature increases; thus, the \\nmolarity of the solution usually decreases as the temperature increases.\\n\\nIn contrast to molarity, solute concentrations expressed as percentage mass, \\nmole fraction, and molality are all temperature independent because they are \\ndefined in terms of mass and mass ratios, which, unlike ratios involving volume, \\ndo not depend on the temperature.\\n\\nSolute concentrations are most commonly expressed as % mass (percentage \\nby mass) when either we do not know the chemical formula of the solute (e.g., \\nwith an unknown) or the substance cannot be described by a single chemical \\nformula because it is a mixture of substances (e.g., a plant extract, an environ-\\nmental sample, or a beverage). For these cases, we can characterize the solute \\nconcentration by simply stating the ratio of the number of grams of dissolved \\nsolute to the total mass of the solution (solute plus solvent); we then multiply \\nthe ratio by 100 to get the percentage by mass of solute, that is,\\n\\n % mass = × 100\\nmass of solute\\n\\n—\\nmass of solute + mass of solvent� �  (16.1)\\n\\nFor example, if we dissolve 5.85 grams of an unknown solute in 100.0 grams of \\nwater, then the % mass of solute in the solution is\\n\\n% mass = × 100 = 5.53%\\n5.85 g\\n\\n—\\n5.85 g + 100.0 g� �\\n\\nRecall from Section 13-8 that the mole fraction of component 1 in a solu-\\ntion, x1, is defined as the ratio of the number of moles of component 1 to the \\ntotal number of moles of all components in the solution:\\n\\n x1 =\\nn1—\\nntot\\n\\n (16.2)\\n\\nIf there are only two components (call them 1 and 2 to denote solvent and \\nsolute, respectively) in the solution, then the mole fraction of component 1 is \\ngiven by\\n\\n x1 =\\nn1—\\n\\nn1 + n2\\n (16.3)\\n\\n\\n\\n16-1. SoluteS AffeCt tHe ProPertieS of tHe Solvent 571\\n\\nSimilarly, the mole fraction of component 2 in the solution is\\n\\n \\nx2 =\\n\\nn2—\\nn1 + n2 \\n\\n(16.4)\\n\\nBecause mole fractions are defined in terms of mole ratios, they are dimension-\\nless quantities. Also, being fractions, the sum of the mole fractions is equal to \\none, as you can see from Equations 16.3 and 16.4. In general, the sum of the \\nmole fractions of all the components in a solution must equal one (unity).\\n\\nThe numerical value of the mole fraction of the solvent in a dilute solution \\nis close to one because in such a case n1 is much greater than n2, or n1 >> n2, \\nmaking n1 + n2 ≈ n1, and so \\n\\nx1 = = 1≈\\nn1—\\n\\nn1 + n2\\n\\nn1—\\nn1\\n\\nConsequently, mole fraction is not a convenient measure of concentration for \\ndilute solutions. In dilute solutions, we usually find it more convenient to use a \\nconcentration unit called molality that is directly proportional to the mole frac-\\ntion of solute in a dilute solution. We define the molality, m, of a solute as the \\nnumber of moles of solute per 1000 grams or one kilogram of solvent:\\n\\n molality = =\\nmoles of solute\\n—\\n1000 g of solvent\\n\\nmoles of solute\\n—\\n1 kilogram of solvent\\n\\n (16.5)\\n\\nFor example, a solution prepared by dissolving 0.100 moles of sodium chloride \\n(5.84 grams) in 1.00 kilograms of water is 0.100 molal (0.100 m) in NaCl(aq). \\nThe unit of molality is the molal designated by m.\\n\\neXAMPle 16-1: Calculate (a) the molality and (b) the mole fractions of \\na solution prepared by dissolving 20.0 grams of sucrose, C12H22O11(s), in \\n0.500 kilograms of water.\\n\\nSolution: (a) The number of moles of sucrose in 20.0 grams is\\n\\nmoles of sucrose = (20.0 g sucrose) = 0.0584 mol\\n1 mol sucrose\\n—\\n342.3 g sucrose� �\\n\\nWhen 0.0584 moles of sucrose are dissolved in 0.500 kilograms of water, the \\nmolality of sucrose in the resulting solution is given by Equation 16.5:\\n\\nm = = 0.117 mol·kg–1 = 0.117 m\\n0.0584 mol\\n—\\n\\n0.500 kg\\n\\n(b) To calculate the mole fractions of sucrose and water in the solution, \\nwe need to know both the number of moles of sucrose and the number \\nof moles of water.

To prepare \\n500.0 mL of a 0.117-M solution of sucrose in water, we dissolve 0.0585 moles of \\nsucrose in less than 500.0 mL of water and dilute the resulting solution with \\nenough water to yield exactly 500.0 mL of solution. Compare this procedure \\nwith the procedure described in Example 16-1 for the preparation of a 0.117-m \\nsucrose solution.\\n\\nIn the following sections of this chapter, we discuss the colligative proper-\\nties of solutions, namely, vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freez-\\ning point depression, and osmotic pressure. It is essential for the understanding \\nof colligative properties to realize that it is the ratio of the number of solute \\nparticles to the number of solvent particles that determines the magnitude of \\na colligative effect. A 0.10-m aqueous sodium chloride solution has twice as \\nmany solute particles per mole of water as a 0.10-m aqueous sucrose solution \\nbecause NaCl(aq) is a strong electrolyte and dissociates completely in water \\nto form Na+(aq) and Cl−(aq) ions, whereas sucrose exists in solution as intact \\nC12H22O11(aq) molecules. We can express this result as an equation by writing\\n\\n mc = im (16.6)\\n\\nwhere i  is the number of solute particles produced per formula unit when the \\nsolute is dissolved in the solvent. We thus distinguish between the molality, \\ndenoted by m, and the colligative molality, denoted by mc.

As Figure 16.1 suggests, the vapor pressure of the solvent \\nover a solution will be less than the vapor pressure of pure solvent at the same \\ntemperature.\\n\\nThe equilibrium vapor pressure results when the rate of evaporation of the \\nsolvent from the solution is equal to the rate of condensation of the solvent from \\nthe vapor (Section 15-6). The rate of evaporation of the solvent from a solution is \\nless than that of the pure solvent because the presence of solute molecules at the \\nsurface of the solution decreases the number of solvent molecules per unit area \\nof surface (Figure 16.1). The rate of condensation is directly proportional to the \\nnumber of molecules per unit volume in the vapor, which in turn is proportional \\nto the vapor pressure. The lower rate of evaporation is balanced by a lower rate of \\ncondensation; the result is a lower equilibrium vapor pressure (Figure 16.2).\\n\\nAs Figure 16.1 implies, the vapor pressure of the solvent over a solution is \\ndirectly proportional to the fraction of solvent particles at the surface.

When \\nthe mole fraction of the solvent is unity, that is, when we have pure solvent, \\nthen P1 is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure solvent, P1°. Thus, when \\nx1 = 1  in Equation 16.7, we have P1 = P1°. If we substitute x1 = 1 and P1 = P1° into \\nEquation 16.7, then we see that k = P1°. Using this determination of k, we can \\nrewrite Equation 16.7 as\\n\\n P1 = x1 P1° (16.8)\\n\\nEquation 16.8 was discovered by the French chemist F. M.

For example, ice formed from seawater is free of salt, and freezing \\nis one method of preparing fresh water from seawater to provide pure drinking \\nwater (Figure 16.7). When an aqueous solution such as NaCl(aq) or seawater \\nbegins to freeze, we have pure ice in equilibrium with the solution.\\n\\nPure ice and a salt solution can coexist in equilibrium only if their vapor \\npressures are equal. But the vapor pressure of water over a NaCl (aq) solution is \\nless than that of pure water, so the vapor pressure of the ice must be less than if \\nit were in equilibrium with pure water. Consequently, the temperature of the ice \\nmust be less than 0°C, and the freezing point of the solution must be less than \\nthat of pure water (Figure 16.4). Thus, we see that the lowering of the vapor \\npressure of a solvent by a solute leads to a lowering of the freezing point of the \\nsolution relative to that of the pure solvent. This effect is called the freezing \\npoint depression.\\n\\nBy arguments analogous to those used to obtain the boiling point elevation \\nequation, the magnitude of the freezing point depression produced by a solute \\nis found to be proportional to its colligative molality mc:\\n\\n T f° – Tf = Kfmc (16.14)\\n\\nwhere T f° is the freezing point of the pure solvent, Tf is the freezing point of the \\nsolution (T f° > Tf), and K f is the freezing point depression constant. The value \\nof K f depends only on the solvent. Values of Kf for various solvents are given in \\nTable 16.2. Once again we note that these results are valid only for dilute solu-\\ntions of nonvolatile solutes.\\n\\nThe value of the freezing point depression constant of water is 1.86 K·mc−1 \\n(Table 16.2). Thus, we predict that an aqueous solution with a colligative molal-\\nity of 0.50 mc has a freezing point depression of\\n\\nT f° – Tf = K fmc = (1.86 K·mc−1)(0.50 mc) = 0.93 K\\n\\nand the freezing point is Tf = 273.15 K − 0.93 K = 272.22 K or −0.93°C.\\nThe freezing point depression due to a dissolved substance is the basis of \\n\\nthe action of antifreezes. The most commonly used antifreeze is ethylene glycol \\n(systematic name: ethane-1,2-diol), which has a boiling point of 197°C and a \\nfreezing point of −17.4°C.

In Example 16-6, the molality is 16.1 m, which is \\nbeyond the range of validity of Equation 16.14. Figure 16.9 shows the predic-\\ntion of Equation 16.14 with actual experimental data for ethylene glycol–water \\nsolutions. Notice that the curve and data agree at low concentrations, but they \\ndeviate from each other at higher concentrations. For a 50.0% by mass ethylene \\nglycol solution, the experimental value of ΔTf is about 40°C instead of the 30°C \\ngiven by Equation 16.14. Nevertheless, Equation 16.14 still gives us a rough esti-\\nmate. The effectiveness of ethylene glycol as an antifreeze is a result of its high \\nboiling point, its chemical stability, and the tendency of the ice that freezes out \\nof the solution to form a slushy mass rather than a solid block. In the absence of \\na sufficient amount of antifreeze, the 9% volume expansion of water on freez-\\ning can generate a force of 200 000 kPa (30 000 lb·in−2). If there is no room \\navailable to accommodate the increase in volume, such a force is more than \\nsufficient to rupture a radiator or even a metal engine block.\\n\\nThe freezing-point depression Equation 16.14 can be combined with \\nEquation 16.6 to obtain the equation\\n\\n T f° – Tf = K fim (16.15)\\n\\nThe i  in Equation 16.15 is called the van’t Hoff i-factor.

Several \\nspecies of fishes can live in the cold waters of the Ross Sea of Antarctica \\nnear the sea ice (Figure 16.10). On the basis of the total concentration of \\nsolutes dissolved in the blood serum of these fishes, the freezing point of \\nthe serum should be −1.46°C. So the blood of these fishes should freeze \\nin the −1.85°C water, but it does not because the fishes are protected from \\nfreezing by “antifreeze” proteins in their blood. These proteins have an \\nenhanced capacity to lower the freezing point of water. In fact, the freezing \\npoint depression of solutions containing the antifreeze proteins is much \\ngreater than that predicted using Equation 16.14. The freezing point of \\nthe fish blood serum, after removal of all the salts (but not the antifreeze \\nproteins), is −0.60°C. The measured concentration of antifreeze proteins \\nin the fish blood is about 3 × 10−4 mc. According to Equation 16.14, the pre-\\ndicted freezing point depression of a 3 × 10−4 mc solution of the antifreeze \\nprotein is only\\n\\nT f° – Tf = (1.86 K·mc−1)(3 × 10−4 mc) = 0.0006 K\\n\\nSuch a solution should freeze at −0.0006°C, but it actually freezes at \\n−0.60°C.

The solubility of NaCl(s) in liquid water around \\n0°C is 4.8 m. In water sodium chloride completely dissociates into Na+(aq) and \\nCl−(aq), and so the colligative molality is twice the molality. Thus the freezing-\\npoint depression of a saturated aqueous NaCl(aq) solution is\\n\\nT f° – Tf = Kfmc = (1.86 K·mc−1)(9.6 mc) = 18 K\\n\\nThe freezing point of the solution, therefore, is −18°C. On contact with ice, salt \\ndissolves to form a saturated aqueous solution with a freezing point of −18°C. \\nAbove −18°C spreading salt on ice causes the ice to melt as it forms a concen-\\ntrated aqueous salt solution. When the ice temperature is below −18°C, spread-\\ning salt on it will not melt the ice because ice freezes out from the saturated \\nNaCl(aq) solution. This effect is also used in the preparation of homemade ice \\ncream to obtain a low enough temperature to solidify cream. The temperature \\nof 0°F on the Fahrenheit temperature scale was chosen as the freezing point \\nof a saturated solution of sodium chloride in water and thus 0°F corresponds \\nto −18°C, whereas the freezing point of pure water on the Fahrenheit tempera-\\nture scale is 32°F.\\n\\nOne problem with the use of rock salt as a roadway deicer is its impact on \\nthe environment, including salt contamination of local water sheds, and accel-\\nerated corrosion of automobiles, bridges, and other structures.

We observe that as time passes the volume of pure water decreases and \\nthe volume of seawater increases (Figure 16.11b). The pure water has a higher \\nequilibrium vapor pressure than the seawater; thus, the rate of condensation of \\nthe water into the seawater is greater than the rate of evaporation of the water \\nfrom the seawater. The net effect is the transfer of water, via the vapor phase, \\nfrom the beaker with pure water to the beaker with seawater. This transfer con-\\ntinues until no pure liquid water remains, and the seawater ends up diluted.\\n\\nIf pure water and seawater are separated by a membrane that is permeable \\nto water but not to the ions in seawater, then the water passes directly through \\nthe membrane from the pure water side of the membrane to the seawater side \\n(Figure 16.12).

The small neutral water molecules can \\nmove between cavities in the strands, whereas the solvated ions such as Na+(aq) \\nand Cl–(aq) are much too large to move through the membrane channels. This \\nkind of membrane is called a semipermeable membrane (Figure 16.13). The ten-\\ndency of the water to pass through the membrane is called the escaping tendency \\nand is directly proportional to the vapor pressure of water over the solution. The \\nescaping tendency of water from pure water is greater than the escaping tendency \\nof water from seawater because pure water has a higher vapor pressure than sea-\\nwater. As water passes through the membrane to the seawater side, the escaping \\ntendency of the water in the seawater increases, not only because the seawater is \\nbeing diluted, but also because of the increased pressure on the seawater side of \\nthe membrane. This pressure increase arises from the pressure due to the height \\nof the water column that develops. Recall from Chapter 13 that a column of liquid \\nexerts a pressure proportional to the height of the column of liquid. The col-\\numn of seawater rises until the escaping tendency of the water in the seawater is \\nequal to the escaping tendency of the pure water. When this condition is attained, \\nan equilibrium exists and the column of seawater no longer rises. The pressure \\nof the liquid column produced in this process is called the osmotic pressure \\n(Figure 16.12). The spontaneous passage of solvent through a semipermeable \\nmembrane from one solution to a more concentrated solution is called osmosis.\\n\\nThe relationship between osmotic pressure, P, solute concentration, and \\ntemperature for a solution was also discovered by van’t Hoff (Frontispiece) and \\nis given by the equation\\n\\n P = RTMc (16.16)\\n\\nwhere R  is the molar gas constant (R = 0.083145 L·bar·mol−1·K−1), T  is the abso-\\nlute temperature, and Mc is the colligative molarity. The value of Mc is given \\nby Mc = iM, where i is the number of solute particles produced per formula \\nunit that is dissolved. Colligative molarity is analogous to colligative molality. In \\ndilute aqueous solutions Mc ≈ mc. If we express Mc as the total number of moles \\nof dissolved solute divided by the volume of the solution, n/V, then Equation \\n16.16 has the same form as the ideal gas equation, namely, PV = nRT.\\n\\nWe have shown that we can increase the escaping tendency of water from \\na solution either by decreasing the solute concentration of the solution or by \\nincreasing the temperature of the solution. The escaping tendency of water \\nfrom a solution also can be increased by applying pressure to the solution. The \\nincrease in pressure increases the average energy of the solvent molecules and \\nthereby increases their escaping tendency. This effect is the basis of osmotic \\npressure. The osmotic pressure is the pressure that must be applied to the solu-\\ntion to increase the vapor pressure (escaping tendency) of the solvent to a value \\nequal to the vapor pressure of the pure solvent at that temperature.\\n\\neXAMPle 16-8: As a rough approximation, seawater can be regarded as a \\n0.55 M NaCl(aq) solution.

Consequently, pure water can be obtained from seawater by using \\na rigid semipermeable membrane and an applied pressure in excess of the \\nosmotic pressure of 26 bar. This process is known as reverse osmosis (Figure \\n16.14). Reverse osmosis units are commercially available and are used to obtain \\nfresh water from salt water using a variety of semipermeable membranes, the \\nmost common of which is cellulose acetate (Figures 16.15 and 16.16).\\n\\nThe magnitude of the osmotic pressure effect makes osmotic pressure mea-\\nsurements an especially powerful method for the determination of the molecu-\\nlar masses of proteins.

In this section we shall discuss solutions con-\\nsisting of two volatile liquids. We define an ideal solution as follows: a solution \\nof two components, A and B, is said to be ideal if the interactions between an \\nA molecule and a B molecule are the same as those between two A molecules \\nor two B molecules. In an ideal solution the A and B molecules are randomly \\ndistributed throughout the solution, including the region near the surface \\n(Figure 16.19). When the molecules of the two components are very similar, \\nthe solution is essentially ideal. For example, benzene and toluene, which have \\nsimilar shapes and charge distributions (see margin), form ideal solutions.\\n\\nIn an ideal solution of two volatile liquids, the vapor pressure of each com-\\nponent is given by Raoult’s law, so\\n\\n PA = xA PA°  and  PB = xB PB° (16.17)\\n\\nfigure 16.18 Osmosis in blood cells.

The vapor \\nover such a solution consists of both components, so the total vapor pressure is\\n\\nPtotal = PA + PB (16.18)\\n\\nSubstituting Equation 16.17 into Equation 16.18 gives\\n\\n Ptotal = xA PA° + xB PB° (16.19)\\n\\nBecause xA + xB = 1, we can set xB = 1 – xA and write Equation 16.19 as\\n\\n Ptotal = PB° + xA (PA° – PB°) (16.20)\\n\\nNotice that for pure B, xA = 0, so Ptotal = PB°, and that when xA = 1 (pure A), \\nPtotal = PA°.\\n\\nIf we plot Ptotal versus xA for an ideal solution, then we obtain a straight line \\nwith an intercept of PB° and a slope of PA° – PB° (Appendix A.6). The total equi-\\nlibrium vapor pressure of a benzene-toluene solution is plotted against the mole \\nfraction of benzene in Figure 16.20. These data confirm that a benzene-toluene \\nsolution is an ideal solution. Note also from Figure 16.20 that because the total \\nvapor pressure over an ideal solution is always between the vapor pressures of \\nthe two pure components, the solution will boil at a temperature between the \\nboiling points of the two pure components.\\n\\neXAMPle 16-10: Given that the equilibrium vapor pressures of pure ben-\\nzene and pure toluene are 183 Torr and 59.2 Torr, respectively, calculate \\n(a) the total vapor pressure over a xbenz = xtol = 0.500 solution and (b) the \\nmole fraction of benzene in the vapor.\\n\\nSolution:  (a) The partial pressures of benzene and toluene over the solu-\\ntion are given by Raoult’s law:\\n\\nPbenz = xbenzP°benz = (0.500)(183 Torr) = 91.5 Torr\\n\\nPtol = xtolP°tol = (0.500)(59.2 Torr) = 29.6 Torr\\n\\nThe total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures:\\n\\nPtotal = Pbenz + Ptol =  91.5 Torr + 29.6 Torr = 121.1 Torr\\n\\nRandom Non random\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n07/09/09\\n\\n016-019 (536)\\n\\nP tot\\nal\\n = \\n\\nP be\\nnz \\n\\n+ P t\\nol\\n\\nP\\ntol  = xtol  P°tol\\n\\nP be\\nnz\\n\\n =\\n x be\\n\\nnz\\n P\\n\\n°be\\nnz\\n\\nP\\n/T\\n\\nor\\nr\\n\\n200\\n\\n150\\n\\n100\\n\\n50\\n\\n0\\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\\n\\nxbenz\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n07/09/09\\n\\n016-020 (537)\\n\\nfigure 16.19 Random and nonrandom distribution \\nof two types of molecules, A (open circles) and B \\n(solid circles), in solution.

If this \\nvapor is condensed and then reevaporated, the resulting vapor will be even \\nricher in benzene. If this condensation-evaporation process is repeated many \\ntimes, a separation of the benzene and toluene is achieved. Such a process is \\ncalled fractional distillation and is carried out automatically in a distillation \\ncolumn of the type shown in Figure 16.21. A fractional distillation column dif-\\nfers from an ordinary distillation column (Section 2-3) in that the former is \\npacked with glass beads, glass rings, or glass wool. The packing material pro-\\nvides a large surface area for the repeated condensation-evaporation process.\\n\\nA plot of the mole fraction of benzene in a benzene-tuoluene mixture dur-\\ning successive stages of fraction distilation is shown in Figure 16.22. Looking \\nat Figure 16.22, if we start with a benzene-toluene mixture that has a mole \\nfraction of benzene of xbenz = 0.20, then in the first stage of boiling, the vapor \\nwill be richer in benzene (the more volatile component) with a mole fraction \\nxbenz ≈ 0.39. This results in a condensate on the first stage of the column that is \\nsimilarly richer in benzene. When this condensate again boils and recondenses \\n(stage two), the resulting condensate has a new mole fraction of benzene of \\nxbenz ≈ 0.59, about three times richer in benzene than the original mixture. If \\nthis process is allowed to continue up the column, the condensate coming out \\nof the top of the column will be essentially pure benzene.\\n\\nRemarkable separations can be achieved with elaborate fractional distilla-\\ntion units. Only 0.015% of the hydrogen atoms in regular water are the deute-\\nrium isotope. Fractional distillation is one method that can be used to separate \\nheavy water, D2O(l ), from regular water. Heavy water is used on a large scale \\nas a coolant in heavy water nuclear power plants and in innumerable chemi-\\ncal investigations ranging from spectroscopy to thermodynamics to chemical \\nsynthesis. Regular water has a normal boiling point of 100.00°C, whereas heavy \\nwater has a normal boiling point of 101.42°C. Heavy water distillation plants \\nproduce almost pure D2O(l ) from regular water at a total cost of around $500 \\nper kilogram of D2O(l ).

For instance, \\nif we attempt to separate ethanol (drinking alcohol) from water by distillation, \\nwe find that no matter how effective a distillation column we use, the distillate \\nissuing from the column has a maximum alcohol content of 95.6%. A 95.6% \\nethanol-plus-water solution distills as if it were a pure liquid. A solution that \\ndistills without change in composition is called an azeotrope. Azeotropes are \\nsolutions that do not behave ideally because of either attractive or repulsive \\nforces between the various components of the solution, resulting in deviations \\nfrom Raoult’s law. Although simple distillation can generate up to 95.6% etha-\\nnol, 100% (pure) ethanol can be prepared from a 95.6% solution ethanol by \\ndehydration with calcium oxide, which removes the water from the solution \\naccording to the equation\\n\\nCaO(s) + H2O(soln) → Ca(OH)2(s)\\n\\nThe Ca(OH)2(s) is filtered off to leave 100% ethanol.\\n\\n16-7.  the Solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly Proportional to \\nthe Pressure of the gas over the liquid\\n\\nThe solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of \\nthe gas in contact with the liquid.

The value of the proportionality con-\\nstant, kh, depends upon the gas, the solvent, and the temperature, and is called \\nthe Henry’s law constant. Henry’s law tells us that if we double the pressure of \\noxygen gas over liquid water, then the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the \\nwater also doubles.

The resulting straight line is \\nin accord with Henry’s law. Henry’s law constants for several common gases are \\ngiven in Table 16.3. The smaller the value of this constant for a gas, the greater \\nthe solubility of the gas, because Mgas = Pgas/kh.\\n\\nCarbonated beverages are pressurized with CO2(g) at a pressure above one \\nbar; sodas are pressurized with CO2(g) at about two bar, and champagne is \\npressurized at four to five bar. The CO2(g) pressure is responsible for the rush \\nof escaping gas that causes the “pop” when the carbonated drink container \\nis opened (sidebox, page 592). The loss of CO2(g) from the solution occurs \\nbecause the average atmospheric partial pressure of CO2(g) is only 3 × 10−4 bar. \\nThe bubbles that form in the liquid are mostly CO2(g) plus some water vapor at \\nabout one bar total pressure.\\n\\nThe air breathed by a diver under water is significantly above atmospheric \\npressure because the diver must exhale the air into an environment that has a \\npressure greater than atmospheric pressure. For example, at a depth of 30 meters \\n(100 feet), the pressure is about three bar, so the diver must breathe air at three \\nbar. At this pressure the solubilities of N2(g) and O2(g) in the blood are three \\ntimes greater than they are at sea level. If a diver ascends too rapidly, then the \\nsudden pressure drop causes the dissolved nitrogen to form numerous small gas \\nbubbles in the blood. This phenomenon, which is extremely painful and can \\nresult in death, is called the bends because it causes the diver to bend over in \\npain. Oxygen, which is readily metabolized, does not accumulate as bubbles in \\nthe blood. However, pure oxygen cannot be used for breathing for extended peri-\\nods because at high oxygen pressures, the need to breathe is greatly reduced. \\nThus, CO2(g) accumulates in the bloodstream and causes CO2(g) asphyxia-\\n\\n0.004\\n\\n0.008\\n\\n0.006\\n\\n0.002\\n\\n0\\n0 2 4 6\\n\\nPO2/bar\\n\\n[O\\n2]\\n\\n/M\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n07/09 /09\\n\\n016-024 (540)\\n\\nfigure 16.23 The solubility of oxygen \\nin water at 25°C plotted against the \\npressure of the oxygen in contact \\nwith the water.

ColligAtive ProPertieS of SolutionS592\\n\\ntion. The solution to these problems was proposed by the American chemist Joel \\nHildebrand (Chapter 12 Frontispiece). Hildebrand’s solution was to substitute \\nhelium for nitrogen. Helium is only about half as soluble in blood as nitrogen; \\nthus, the magnitude of the problem is cut in half. Divers’ “air” tanks contain \\na mixture of He(g) and O2(g) adjusted so that the pressure of O2(g) is about \\n0.20 bar at maximum dive depth, thereby also avoiding the CO2(g) asphyxiation \\nproblem.\\n\\nThe solubility of gases in liquids decreases with increasing temperature, \\nbecause of the increase in escaping tendency of the solute gas with increasing \\ntemperature. Cold water in equilibrium with air has a higher concentration \\nof dissolved oxygen than warm water. The decreased solubility of oxygen with \\nincreased temperature is one reason why more active fishes, such as trout and \\ntuna, tend to live in cooler water.\\n\\nSuMMAry\\nThe concentration of a solute can be expressed in various concentration units, \\nsuch as mass percent, molarity, molality, and mole fraction.\\n\\nVapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, \\nand osmotic pressure are colligative properties. The key point in understand-\\ning the colligative properties of solutions is realizing that the equilibrium vapor \\npressure of a solvent is reduced when a solute is dissolved in it. If a solution is \\nsufficiently dilute, then the equilibrium vapor pressure of the solvent is given \\nby Raoult’s law. Colligative properties of solutions depend only on the solute \\nparticle concentration and are independent of the chemical nature of the solute.\\n\\nOsmotic pressure is the largest of the colligative effects and can be used to \\ndetermine the molecular mass of proteins. Osmotic pressure effects are impor-\\ntant in biological systems because osmotic pressure keeps biological cells inflated.\\n\\nWHy do SodAS “eXPlode”? Every kid knows that if you shake \\nup a can of soda and then open it, the soda “explodes” (sprays out of \\nthe can). Why does this happen? Recall from Chapter 15 that water \\nhas a significant surface tension. Even though the carbon dioxide dis-\\nsolved in a soda is at a pressure of about two bar, the surface tension \\nof water resists the formation of bubbles within the solution, causing \\nthe dissolved CO2(g) to escape slowly. When you shake up a soda you \\nmechanically generate bubbles in the solution that help the CO2(g) to \\nescape when the soda is opened. If a shaken soda is left to stand, these \\nbubbles will eventually float to the top returning the soda to its origi-\\nnal (unshaken) state. When an ice cube is dropped in a glass of soda, \\nthe solution fizzes because of small sites on the surface of the ice that \\nassist in the formation of bubbles. One way to create a dramatic explo-\\nsion with soda is to quickly drop a roll of mint candies, such as Wint-O-\\nGreen Lifesavers® or Mentos®, into an open soda bottle. These candies \\nhave many more such sites on their surfaces than ice and catalyze the \\nformation of bubbles so rapidly that a “fountain” of soda pop results! \\n(This experiment is quite messy and should not be done indoors.)\\n\\n\\n\\nequAtionS you SHould knoW HoW to uSe 593\\n\\nRaoult’s law also applies to ideal solutions consisting of two volatile liquids. \\nIdeal solutions result when the interactions between unlike molecules in the \\nsolution are the same as the interactions between like molecules. If this is not \\nthe case, then the solution is not ideal and deviations from Raoult’s law are \\nobserved. Fractional distillation can be used to separate a mixture of two vola-\\ntile liquids.\\n\\nHenry’s law states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly propor-\\ntional to the pressure of the gas over the solution.

Chemical Kinetics: Rate Laws\\n\\nDifferent chemical reactions take place at different rates. Some reactions, such as the reaction between AgNO3(aq) and KCl(aq) to produce a pre-\\ncipitate of AgCl(s), seem to occur almost instantaneously, whereas other reac-\\ntions, such as the reaction between H2(g) and N2(g) to produce NH3(g), occur \\nvery slowly. Chemists study the rates of chemical reactions to determine the \\nconditions under which reactions can be made to proceed at favorable rates. \\nCertainly, if a chemist desires to produce a particular product, then the reac-\\ntion used must take place at an appreciable rate. This condition is particularly \\nimportant for reactions used for the commercial production of chemicals. As \\nwe shall see, reaction kinetics can also be applied to the rate of decay of radioac-\\ntive isotopes, which are important in nuclear chemistry, medicine, archaeology, \\nand geology.\\n\\nA principal goal of a chemical kinetics experiment is to deduce how the \\nrate of a reaction depends upon the concentrations of the species involved. \\nThis result is called the rate law of the reaction. The reaction rate law can be \\ndetermined only by experiment. In the next chapter, we shall see how the re-\\naction rate law provides the most important clue to the reaction mechanism, \\nwhich is the sequence of steps by which the reactants are converted to products. \\nAn understanding of reaction mechanisms may enable us to adjust reaction \\nconditions in order to produce a desired rate of reaction and may increase our \\nunderstanding of how chemical reactions occur at the molecular level. Such  \\nan understanding enables us to control chemical reactions better and to manu-\\nfacture chemical products in the most economical way.\\n\\n17-1.  A Rate of Concentration Change Tells Us How Fast a \\nQuantity of Reactant or Product Is Changing with Time\\n\\nLet’s consider the decomposition of azomethane, CH3N2CH3(g), to ethane, \\nC2H6(g), and nitrogen, N2(g), which can be described by the chemical equation\\n\\n CH3 CH3(g) → CH3CH3(g) + N2(g)N N  (17.1)\\n\\nThe rate of this reaction can be determined spectroscopically by measuring \\nhow the spectrum of any one of these three species changes in intensity as a \\nfunction of time. Because two moles of gaseous products are formed for each \\nmole of reactant that is consumed in Equation 17.1, we could also follow the \\n\\n 17-1  Reaction Rates\\n 17-2  Rates and Time\\n 17-3  Initial Rates\\n 17-4  First-Order Reactions\\n 17-5  Half-Life of First-Order Reactions\\n\\n 17-6  Radioactive Decay\\n 17-7  Carbon-14 Dating\\n 17-8  Second-Order Reactions\\n 17-9  Half-Life of Second-Order Reactions\\n\\n\\n\\n17.

We shall denote the concentration of a species by enclosing its chemical \\nformula in square brackets. Figure 17.1 shows that [CH3N2CH3] decreases with \\ntime, while [C2H6] and [N2] increase with time. Note also that [C2H6] and [N2] \\nincrease at the same rate because they are produced on a one-to-one mole basis.\\n\\nLet’s see how we can use the change in concentration of a species in a reac-\\ntion to determine the rate of a reaction. Suppose that we know the concentra-\\ntion of the ethane gas at some time, t1, to be [C2H6]1, and suppose we find that at \\nsome later time, t2, it is [C2H6]2. We can write the change in its concentration as\\n\\nD[C2H6] = [C2H6]2 – [C2H6]1\\n\\nHere the D (delta) stands for change, or later value minus earlier value. Because \\nthe concentration of the product increases with time, we see that D[C2H6] will \\nbe a positive quantity. Similarly, the change in time is Dt = t2 – t1, which is also a \\npositive quantity.

The Rate Law of a Reaction Can be Determined  \\nby the method of Initial Rates\\n\\nWe have noted that the rate of a reaction changes as the reactants are consumed \\nand the products are formed. This change occurs because the rates of chemical \\nreactions often depend on the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. \\nThe mathematical equation that relates the concentrations of the reactants to \\nthe rate of reaction is called the rate law of the reaction. Many experiments \\nshow that the rate of a reaction is typically proportional to the concentrations \\nof the reactants raised to small integer powers. Thus, for the case of the thermal \\ndecomposition of N2O5(g) described by Equation 17.4, we shall assume that\\n\\n rate of reaction ~ [N2O5]x (17.8)\\n\\nWe can write this proportionality as an equation by inserting a proportionality \\nconstant:\\n\\n rate of reaction = k[N2O5]x (17.9)\\n\\nThe proportionality constant, k, in a rate law is called the rate constant of the \\nreaction.\\n\\nThe value of x in Equation 17.9 must be determined experimentally; it is not \\nnecessarily the same as the balancing coefficient of N2O5(g) in the chemical \\nequation. There is no relation between the balancing coefficients in a chemical equation \\nand the reaction rate law. For example, the rate law for the reaction described by \\nthe equation\\n\\nN2O3(g) → NO(g) + NO2(g)\\n\\nis\\n\\nrate of reaction = k[N2O3]\\n\\nwhereas the rate law for the reaction described by the equation\\n\\nNOBr(g) → NO(g) + 1_2 Br2(g)\\n\\nis\\n\\nrate of reaction = k[NOBr]2\\n\\nReaction rate laws can often be determined from data involving reaction \\nrates at the early stages of reactions. Using the method of initial rates, we mea-\\nsure the rate of a reaction over an initial time interval short enough that the \\nconcentrations of the reactants do not vary appreciably from their initial values. \\nIf we use zeros as subscripts to denote the initial values of the rate of reaction \\nand of the various concentrations, then for any reaction described by an equa-\\ntion of the form\\n\\naA + bB + cC → products\\n\\n\\n\\n61117-3.

As a simple example, let’s consider the N2O5(g) decomposition \\nreaction, in which there is only one reactant, as described by the equation\\n\\nN2O5(g) → 2 NO2(g) + 1_2 O2(g)\\n\\nSuppose that we run this reaction using successively doubled concentrations of \\nN2O5(g) and obtain the following initial-rate data at 45°C:\\n\\nRun [N2O5]0/mol·L–1 (rate of reaction)0/mol·L–1·h–1\\n\\n1 0.010 0.018\\n\\n2 0.020 0.036\\n\\n 3 0.040 0.072\\n\\nNotice that when the initial concentration, [N2O5]0, is increased by a factor of \\ntwo, the initial rate of reaction, (rate of reaction)0, also increases by a factor \\nof two. These results show that (rate of reaction)0 is directly proportional to \\n[N2O5]0, so we can write\\n\\n (rate of reaction)0 = k[N2O5]0 (17.11)\\n\\nshowing that x = 1 in Equation 17.10.\\nExtensive experimental studies show that in many cases the reaction rate \\n\\nlaw determined from initial-rate data describes the rate of reaction as the reac-\\ntion proceeds. Thus, we can drop the subscript zero in Equation 17.11 to obtain \\nthe rate law:\\n\\n rate of reaction = k[N2O5] (17.12)\\n\\nBecause [N2O5] is raised to the first power in Equation 17.12, the rate law is said \\nto be a first-order rate law, and the reaction is said to be a first-order reaction. \\nWe say that the rate law is first order in [N2O5].\\n\\nWe can determine the value of the rate constant k in Equation 17.12 by \\nusing the tabulated initial-rate data. If we substitute the fact that (rate of reac- \\ntion)0 = 0.072 mol?L–1?h–1 when [N2O5]0 = 0.040 mol?L–1, then we obtain\\n\\n(rate of reaction)0\\n—\\n\\n[N2O5]0\\n\\n0.072 mol·L–1·h–1\\n—\\n\\n0.040 mol·L–1\\nk = = = 1.8 h–1\\n\\nNotice that the units of the rate constant for a first-order reaction are reciprocal \\ntime (time–1).\\n\\nThe following Example shows that the initial concentrations in the various \\nruns do not have to be simple whole multiples of one another.\\n\\n\\n\\n17.

Thus, we say that the reac-\\ntion is zero order in [CO]. In other words, the rate of reaction is indepen-\\ndent of the concentration of [CO]. This is a surprising result! Who would \\nthink from the stated reaction equation that the rate of the reaction would \\nnot depend on the concentration of carbon monoxide present? We shall \\nexplain why this is the case for this reaction in the next chapter. This result \\ndoes not mean that this reaction will occur when no CO(g) is present (that \\nis clearly impossible); just that under the conditions of this experiment, the \\nrate of the reaction does not depend on how much CO(g) is available, and \\nthat an increase or decrease in [CO] does not affect the rate of reaction.\\n\\nAlthough the rate does not depend on [CO]0, the rate does depend on \\n[NO2]0. Here simple inspection of the data suffices to determine the rate \\nlaw: As we double [NO2]0 in going from 0.15 M to 0.30 M while keeping \\n[CO]0 constant, we quadruple the rate of reaction. In going from 0.15 M to \\n0.60 M, a fourfold increase in concentration, we increase the rate of reac-\\ntion by a factor of 16 (in this case the change in the concentration of [CO]0 \\ndoes not matter, because we have already determined the reaction to be \\nzero order in [CO], or independent of CO(g) concentration).

Thus, the expression radioactive \\ndecay refers to a process in which one nucleus is spontaneously converted into \\nanother.\\n\\nNot all radioactive nuclei decay at the same rate. Some radioactive samples \\ndecay in a few millionths of a second; the same amount of another isotope may \\ntake billions of years to decay. Radioactive decay is an excellent example of \\na first-order kinetic process. An important aspect of radioactive decay is that \\nits rate is independent of external factors such as temperature, pressure, and \\nchemical bonding, at least under terrestrial conditions.

Carbon-14 Can be Used to Date  \\nCertain Archaeological objects\\n\\nNaturally occurring uranium-238, which is radioactive, decays through a series \\nof processes to lead-206. The overall process is\\n\\n238\\n92 U → \\n\\n206\\n82 Pb + 8 \\n\\n4\\n2 He + 6  \\n\\n0\\n–1 e\\n\\nThe first step of this decay series is\\n\\n238\\n92 U → \\n\\n234\\n90 Th + \\n\\n4\\n2 He\\n\\nwith a half-life of 4.47 × 109 years. The half-life for the overall decay process is \\n4.51 × 109 years, and so once the U-238 decays to Th-234, the subsequent decay \\nto Pb-206 occurs relatively quickly. This means that we can treat the decay of \\nU-238 to Pb-206 as if it occurs in a single step. For example, suppose that a \\nsample of uranium ore is found to contain equal molar quantities of U-238 and \\nPb-206. Because half of the U-238 nuclei initially present have decayed since the \\nrock was formed, we conclude that the rock is 4.51 × 109 years old. This method \\nis called uranium-lead dating. The oldest rocks analyzed by this method are 3.6 \\nbillion years old, which is about one billion years less than the present estimate \\nof the age of the earth. Rocks that were obtained from the moon by the Apollo \\nprogram indicate that the moon is about the same age as the earth.\\n\\nRadiodating methods used to determine the age of rocks and ores are not \\nuseful for materials less than about a million years old, because the half-lives of \\nthe radioactive minerals used in this method are more than one billion years. \\nConsequently, not enough decay occurs in less than one million years to be \\nmeasured accurately. In the 1940s, Willard Libby (Figure 17.8) developed a \\nmethod of using carbon-14 to date carbon-containing objects derived from for-\\nmerly living materials. His method is useful for dating objects less than about \\n30 000 years old. It has found wide use in archaeology, and Libby was awarded \\nthe 1960 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work.\\n\\nThe idea behind Libby’s carbon-14 dating method, also called radiocarbon \\ndating, is as follows. The earth’s upper atmosphere is being bombarded con-\\nstantly by radiation from the sun and other parts of the universe. As a result, \\na small but fairly constant amount of carbon-14 is produced in the reaction \\nbetween cosmic ray neutrons and atmospheric nitrogen:\\n\\n14\\n7 N + \\n\\n1\\n0 n → \\n\\n14\\n6 C + \\n\\n1\\n1 H\\n\\nCarbon-14 is radioactive and decays by the reaction\\n\\n14\\n6 C → \\n\\n14\\n7 N +  \\n\\n0\\n–1 e\\n\\nThe half-life of carbon-14 is 5730 years. The carbon-14 produced eventually \\nreacts with oxygen and appears in the atmosphere as 14CO2(g). Because the \\n14CO2(g) diffuses throughout the earth’s atmosphere, a small but fairly constant \\nfraction of atmospheric CO2(g) contains carbon-14.\\n\\nFigure 17.8 Willard F. Libby (1908–\\n1980) was born in Grand Valley, \\nColorado, but grew up in Sebastopol, \\nCalifornia. He was a tall and powerfully \\nbuilt young man and played tackle on \\nhis high school football team, where he \\nearned the nickname “Wild Bill.” He \\nreceived his B.S. and Ph.D. in chemistry \\nfrom the University of California at \\nBerkeley, where he remained on the \\nfaculty until the outbreak of World \\nWar II. He worked on the Manhattan \\nProject at Columbia University during \\nthe war years. In 1945 he became a \\nprofessor at the University of Chicago, \\nwhere he and his students developed \\nthe carbon-14 dating method that \\nproved so useful to archaeologists. \\nLibby was the first chemist to be \\nappointed to the Atomic Energy \\nCommission. He was a strong advocate \\nfor the industrial use of radioisotopes \\nand nuclear energy for nonmilitary \\npurposes. In 1959 he returned to the \\nacademic world, accepting a faculty \\nposition at the University of California \\nat Los Angeles, where he remained \\nuntil his retirement in 1976. Libby was \\nawarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\nin 1960 for the development of \\nradiocarbon dating.\\n\\n\\n\\n17-7.

As a result, all living plants and animals (including you) \\ncontain a fraction of carbon-14 atoms that is the same as that in atmospheric \\nCO2(g). Although the carbon-14 is continually decaying, as long as the organ-\\nism continues to incorporate carbon-containing materials derived from atmo-\\nspheric CO2(g), the amount of carbon-14 per gram of carbon in the organism \\nremains constant. The number of the carbon-14 disintegrations per unit time in \\nall living organisms is a constant: the measured value is 15.3 disintegrations per \\nminute per gram of total carbon. When the organism dies, it no longer incor-\\nporates carbon-14, so the quantity of carbon-14 decreases with time according \\nto Equation 17.23, with t½ equal to 5730 years.\\n\\nTo determine the age of an object, we first solve Equation 17.23 for t, to \\nobtain\\n\\n \\n\\nt1⁄ 2—\\n0.693\\n\\nt = ln� � N0—N  (17.25)\\nIf we substitute the value of the half-life of carbon-14 (5730 years) into Equation \\n17.25, we obtain\\n\\n \\nt = (8.27 × 103 years)ln\\n\\nN0—\\nN  \\n\\n(17.26)\\n\\nWe can convert the ratio N0/N to a more convenient form by realizing that \\nbecause radioactive decay is a first-order process, the 15.3 disintegrations per \\nminute per gram of carbon in living things is proportional to N0, the initial \\nnumber of carbon-14 nuclei per gram of carbon present in the sample. We \\ncan write this as N0 ~ 15.3. Similarly, if R is the present disintegration rate of \\ncarbon-14 per minute per gram of carbon in the nonliving sample, then R ~ N. \\nThus, the ratio N0/N is given by\\n\\n \\n=\\n\\n15.3\\n—\\nR \\n\\nN0—\\nN  \\n\\nIf we substitute this equation into Equation 17.26, we get\\n\\n \\nt = (8.27 × 103 years)ln\\n\\n15.3 disintegration·min–1·g –1\\n—\\n\\nR � � (17.27)\\nwhere, once again, R is the present disintegration rate of carbon-14 in units of \\ndisintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. If we assume that the atmo-\\nspheric level of carbon-14 is the same now as when the artifact to be analyzed \\nwas living matter, then the age of the artifact can be determined by measur-\\ning R .\\n\\nThe assumptions of carbon-14 dating have been tested extensively against \\nother archaeological dating techniques, such as tree-ring dating methods. \\nThese comparisons show that the carbon-14 level in the atmosphere fluctuates \\nover time, but these fluctuations are not large.\\n\\nThe following Example illustrates the use of Equation 17.27.\\n\\n\\n\\n17.

Assum-\\ning that only C5H6(g) was present initially, determine the rate of reaction \\nand the value of the rate constant.\\n\\nSolution: First, we must determine the pressure of C5H6(g) as a function of \\ntime. We use the fact that the total pressure is given by\\n\\n Ptotal = PC5H6 + PC10H12 (17.33)\\n\\nBecause one mole of C10H12(g) is produced from every two moles of C5H6(g) \\nthat react, we can write\\n\\n PC10H12 = \\n1_\\n2 (P°C5H6 – PC5H6)  (17.34)\\n\\nIn this equation, P°C5H6 is the initial pressure of C5H6(g).

The reaction-rate law describes the de-\\npendence of the rate of reaction on the concentrations of the various species \\ninvolved. A first-order rate law is proportional to the first power of the reactant \\nconcentration; a second-order rate law is proportional to the second power of \\nthe reactant concentration; and a zero-order reaction is independent of reac-\\ntant concentration.\\n\\nThe decay of a radioactive substance is a first-order kinetic process. An im-\\nportant property of a first-order kinetic process is that its rate of reaction is char-\\nacterized by a half-life, which is the time required for one-half of the amount \\nof a sample to react. The half-life is characteristic of a given radioisotope and is \\na direct measure of how rapidly it decays. The half-lives of radioisotopes range \\nfrom less than a picosecond to billions of years. Rates of radioactive decay are \\nused to determine the age of rocks and archaeological objects.\\n\\nA test plot can be used to determine if a reaction is first or second order in \\n[A]. If a reaction is first order in [A], a plot of ln[A] versus t will be linear. If a \\nreaction is second order in [A], a plot of 1/[A] versus t will be linear.

He studied medicine at the University \\nof Berlin, where he received his doctorate in 1897. He was an assistant to several prominent \\nmedical scientists from 1898 to 1906. Because no university and research positions were available \\nat the time, he accepted the directorship of the bacteriology laboratory in the Charité Hospital in \\nBerlin. In spite of limited funds and research space, he did significant medical and biochemical \\nresearch, attracting many students from around the world. In 1922, he was invited to spend three \\nyears at the medical school of the University of Nagoya in Japan, where he continued his research \\non the theory of pH. After three years at Johns Hopkins University, he received a permanent \\nposition at the Rockefeller Institute, where he remained until his death. In addition to his \\nexpertise in medicine and chemistry, he was proficient in mathematics, pioneering the use of \\nmathematics in the biological sciences. Michaelis had a talent for languages and became fluent \\nin Japanese as well as several other languages. He was also a talented musician with a lifelong \\ninterest in the theory of music.\\n\\nMaud Menten (1879–1960) was born in Port Lambton, Ontario, Canada. She graduated from \\nthe University of Toronto in 1904 and remained there to earn her M.D. in 1911, one of the \\nfirst women in Canada to receive a medical doctorate. Because women were not allowed to do \\nresearch in Canada at the time, she left to pursue her career in Germany and then the United \\nStates. In 1912, she spent a year with Leonor Michaelis in Berlin working on enzyme kinetics, \\nresulting in the famous Michaelis-Menten equation. She later received her Ph.D. in biochemistry \\nfrom the University of Chicago in 1916. Unable to find a suitable position in Canada, she joined \\nthe department of pathology in the medical school at the University of Pittsburgh in 1919. In \\nspite of her productivity, she was not promoted to full professor until 1949, when she was 70 years \\nold. After retiring in 1950 she returned to Canada, where she died in 1960. Despite suffering \\nfrom arthritis, she was an accomplished musician and painter; many of her paintings were \\nexhibited in Pittsburgh art galleries and museums.\\n\\n\\n\\n649\\n\\n18.

We often describe the reaction rate by specifying its order with respect to each \\nof the reactants. Common reaction orders are first order and second order. We \\nalso saw that it is not possible to deduce the rate law of a reaction from its chemi-\\ncal equation. In this chapter, we shall introduce the idea of a reaction mecha-\\nnism; that is, a sequence of so-called elementary reactions that add up to give \\nthe overall reaction. Each of the elementary reactions is easy to deal with, allow-\\ning us to visualize a reaction in terms of simple (elementary) steps. We then go \\non to study the conditions necessary for a chemical reaction to occur and learn \\nthe relationship between reaction rates and temperature. An understanding \\nof these conditions along with a reaction mechanism allows us to optimize the \\nconditions under which a reaction takes place and provides insight into how \\nchemical processes occur at the molecular level. We then learn about catalysts. \\nA catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction, but is not \\nconsumed in the reaction. We shall see that a catalyst functions by supplying \\nan alternative, more favorable, chemical pathway for a reaction. Catalysts are of \\ngreat importance in chemistry, as they allow us to produce reaction products \\nfaster with less energy expenditure. In the final section we shall look at the cata-\\nlysts used by living systems, called enzymes, and learn how enzymes affect the \\nrates of some important biological processes.\\n\\n18-1. Many Reactions Involve More Than One Step\\nAs we emphasized in the previous chapter, a balanced chemical equation \\nshows the stoichiometric relationship between the reactants and the products. \\nHowever, it gives no indication of the rate law or how the reactants are con-\\nverted into products. For example, a reaction equation that we discussed in the \\nprevious chapter is\\n\\nNO2(g) + CO(g) → NO(g) + CO2(g)\\n\\nYou might guess from this equation that a NO2(g) molecule collides with a \\nCO(g) molecule and that during the collision an oxygen atom is transferred \\n\\n\\n\\n18. CHeMICaL KIneTICS: MeCHanISMS650\\n\\nfrom the NO2(g) molecule to the CO(g) molecule. It would seem that increas-\\ning the concentration of either would make a collision more likely to occur, so \\nthat the rate of the reaction should depend on both [NO2] and [CO]. But as we \\nsaw in Example 17-5, the rate law for this reaction is rate of reaction = k[NO2]2, \\nwhich is independent of [CO].\\n\\nIt has been determined experimentally that the reaction is more involved \\nthan a single collision between a NO2(g) molecule and a CO(g) molecule, and \\nactually occurs in two steps. In the first step, two NO2(g) molecules collide and an \\noxygen atom is transferred from one NO2(g) molecule to the other according to\\n\\n(1)     NO2(g) + NO2(g) → NO3(g) + NO(g)\\n\\nNow the NO3(g) species collides with a CO(g) molecule, and an oxygen atom is \\ntransferred from NO3(g) to the CO(g) molecule as described by the equation\\n\\n(2)  NO3(g) + CO(g) → NO2(g) + CO2(g)\\n\\nEach of the two steps described by equations (1) and (2) is called an elementary \\nreaction. Elementary reactions are reactions that occur in a single step. The \\nsum of these two elementary reaction equations gives the equation for the over-\\nall reaction:\\n\\nA series of elementary reaction equations that add up to give a reaction \\nequation is called a reaction mechanism. A reaction mechanism is a step-by-\\nstep description of the molecular pathway of a chemical reaction. Chemists are \\ninterested in not only what the products of a reaction are but also just how the \\nproducts are formed from the reactants. One of the goals of chemical kinetics \\nis the elucidation of reaction mechanisms. If we know the mechanism of a reac-\\ntion, then we can often manipulate the reaction conditions to produce greater \\nyields of a desired product or to control its rate of production. The task of \\ndetermining a reaction mechanism often involves a great deal of experimental \\ndetective work. For example, the innocent-looking reaction between hydrogen \\nand oxygen to produce water that we express as\\n\\n2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l )\\n\\nis known to involve over ten steps, and no universally accepted mechanism has \\nyet been proposed.\\n\\nNote that the species NO3(g) in the two-step mechanism of the NO2(g) + \\nCO(g) reaction cancels out when the two elementary reaction equations are \\nadded to give the equation for the overall reaction. Such a species, called an \\nintermediate species or simply an intermediate, is produced in one step of a \\nreaction and consumed in a subsequent step. An intermediate, therefore, does \\nnot appear in the overall equation for the reaction. An intermediate is usually \\nan unstable, reactive species. However, it does exist in the reaction mixture, and \\nits presence can often be detected experimentally. Using modern spectroscopic \\n\\n (1) NO2(g) + NO2(g) → NO3(g) + NO(g)\\n (2) NO3(g) + CO(g) → NO2(g) + CO2(g)\\n\\n overall: NO2(g) + CO(g) → NO(g) + CO2(g)\\n\\n\\n\\n651\\n\\ntechniques, it is possible to detect species with lifetimes of only microseconds or \\neven nanoseconds. It is the possible involvement of one or more intermediates \\nthat makes it impossible to deduce a reaction mechanism solely from the overall \\nreaction stoichiometry.\\n\\nBecause an elementary reaction takes place in a single step, we can write its \\nrate law directly from the stoichiometry of the elementary reaction equation. \\nThis, in fact, is just another way of defining an elementary reaction. This obser-\\nvation suggests that the rate law for the elementary reaction\\n\\n(1) NO2(g) + NO2(g) \\uf8e7\\nk1\\n\\n → NO3(g) + NO(g) (18.1)\\n\\nis\\n\\nrate of reaction 1 = k1[NO2][NO2] = k1[NO2]2\\n\\nand that for\\n\\n(2) NO3(g) + CO(g) \\uf8e7\\nk2\\n\\n → NO2(g) + CO2(g) (18.2)\\n\\nis\\n\\n                            rate of reaction 2 = k2[NO3][CO]\\n\\nElementary reactions that involve the reaction of two molecules (which may \\nor may not be chemically distinct) are referred to as bimolecular reactions. \\nEquations 18.1 and 18.2 describe bimolecular reactions. In contrast, reactions \\ninvolving only a single species are called unimolecular reactions. The sponta-\\nneous decay of radioactive nuclei is an example of a unimolecular reaction.\\n\\nWe stress that you can write the reaction-rate law from the stoichiometry of \\na chemical equation of that reaction only  for an elementary reaction equation. \\nYou cannot deduce the reaction-rate law from the stoichiometry of a general \\n(nonelementary) chemical equation; it must always be determined experimen-\\ntally. Once you have experimentally determined a reaction-rate law, you can \\nthen propose a mechanism consisting of one or more elementary steps that is \\nconsistent with this rate law.\\n\\neXaMPLe 18-1: The reaction described by\\n\\n2NO2(g) + F2(g) → 2NO2F(g)\\n\\nis thought to proceed via the following two-step mechanism:\\n\\n(1)    NO2(g) + F2(g) \\uf8e7\\nk1\\n\\n → NO2F(g) + F(g)\\n(2)     F(g) + NO2(g) \\uf8e7\\n\\nk2\\n → NO2F(g)\\n\\nwhere k1 and k2 are rate constants.

Reactants Must Surmount an energy Barrier to React\\nBecause an elementary reaction occurs in a single step, it is the simplest type \\nof reaction to treat theoretically. One approach is called the collision theory \\nof reaction rates. Its basic postulate is that two species must collide with each \\nother in order to react. In one liter of a mixture of the gases A(g) and B(g) at \\none bar and 25°C, the collision frequency between A(g) and B(g) molecules is \\nabout 1031 s−1. If every collision led to a reaction, then the initial reaction rate \\nwould be about\\n\\n \\n\\n1031 s–1\\n—\\n\\n1 L\\n1 mol\\n\\n—\\n6.022 × 1023\\n\\n≈ 107 mol·L–1·s–1rate of reaction = � �� �\\nIn fact, very few reactions occur at this extremely high rate; most occur at a \\n\\nmuch lower rate. The inescapable conclusion is that most collisions do not lead \\nto a chemical reaction. Unless the following two conditions are met, the collid-\\ning molecules simply bounce off each other unchanged.\\n\\nThe first and more obvious condition is that the molecules must collide \\nwith sufficient energy either to break or to rearrange bonds. The other condi-\\ntion is that the molecules must collide in some preferred relative orientation. \\nFigure 18.1 illustrates these conditions for the collision of a F2(g) molecule with \\na NO2(g) molecule (see Example 18-1). A reactive collision will occur only if \\nthe two molecules have sufficient energy and if, in addition, the F2(g) molecule \\nstrikes the nitrogen atom of the NO2(g) molecule. Even if the two molecules \\ncollide very energetically, collisions with any other relative orientation will not \\nlead to a reaction.\\n\\n\\n\\n653\\n\\nThese two requirements are the basis of the collision theory of reaction \\nrates. To incorporate them, we write the reaction rate for the elementary reac-\\ntion equation\\n\\nA(g) + B(g) → C(g) + D(g)\\n\\nas\\n\\nrate of reaction = collisionfrequency� �\\nfraction of\\n\\ncollisions with\\nthe required\\n\\nenergy� �\\nfraction of collisions\\nin which molecules\\nhave the required\\n\\nrelative orientation� � (18.3)\\nLet’s look at each of the terms in parentheses in turn. The two major fac-\\n\\ntors that affect the collision frequency are concentration and temperature. The \\ngreater the concentration of the reactant molecules, the greater the frequency \\nof collisions. For two reactant species, A(g) and B(g), the collision frequency is \\nproportional to the product of their concentrations, or\\n\\n collision frequency ∝ [A][B] (18.4)\\n\\nThe collision frequency also increases with temperature because the root-mean-\\nsquare molecular speed increases with temperature (see Equation 13.29). The \\nfaster the molecules are moving, the more frequently they collide.\\n\\nNow let’s consider the second term in parentheses in Equation 18.3. \\nFigure 18.2 shows a plot of the number of collisions per second of the A(g) \\nand B(g) molecules versus the kinetic energy of the colliding molecules. The \\nfraction of collisions with a kinetic energy in excess of some fixed energy, \\nsuch as Ea in the figure, increases with increasing temperature.

Molecules that collide with a relative kinetic energy less than Ea simply \\nbounce off each other. A colliding pair that does have the required energy Ea\\ncan react, provided they have the required relative orientation.\\n\\nNow we consider the final term in Equation 18.3. As we have seen, two mol-\\necules can react only if they have the correct relative orientation. As we saw in \\nFigure 18.1, this depends on the shapes of the colliding molecules.\\n\\nIn Equation 18.3, then, only the collision frequency depends on the concen-\\ntrations of A(g) and B(g). If we substitute Equation 18.4 into 18.3, we see that \\nfor an elementary reaction involving two species A and B\\n\\n rate of reaction = k[A][B] (18.5)\\n\\nwhere the rate constant k  depends on the other factors present in Equation 18.3; \\nthat is, the rate constant depends on temperature and the shapes of the mole-\\ncules. Equation 18.5 gives us the rate law for an elementary reaction directly \\nfrom its chemical equation. As we stated in the previous section, this is true, of \\ncourse, only for an elementary reaction. Equation 18.5 can also be applied to \\nreactions that occur in solution.\\n\\nFigure 18.3 illustrates the activation energy for the elementary reaction \\ndescribed by A + B → C + D.

The arrhenius equation Describes the Temperature \\nDependence of a Reaction-Rate Constant\\n\\nIn almost all cases, an increase in temperature will increase the rate of a \\nreaction. In this section we study the effect of temperature on reaction-rate \\nconstants.\\n\\nLet’s go back to Equation 18.3, which expresses the rate of a reaction as the \\nproduct of three factors: the collision frequency, the fraction of collisions with \\nsufficient kinetic energy, and the fraction of collisions in which the colliding \\npair of molecules has the appropriate relative orientation. We have seen that \\ntwo of these terms depend on the temperature. We can use the kinetic theory \\nof gases to evaluate each of the terms. The final result for the reaction-rate con-\\nstant, k, can be expressed as\\n\\n k = pze –Ea/RT (18.6)\\n\\nIn this equation, p, called a steric factor, is the fraction of collisions with the \\ncorrect relative orientations; z is the collision frequency; Ea is the activation \\nenergy in units of J·mol–1; R is the molar gas constant (8.3145 J·mol−1·K−1); and \\nT  is the Kelvin temperature.\\n\\nThe factor e –Ea/RT is the fraction of collisions with energy greater than Ea. \\nThis factor varies strongly with temperature, but the quantities p  and z  do not \\nvary appreciably. We shall denote their product by A and consider it to be a con-\\nstant. Thus, Equation 18.6 can be written as\\n\\n k = Ae –Ea/RT (18.7)\\n\\nEquation 18.7, which was first proposed in 1889 by the Swedish chemist Svante \\nArrhenius (Chapter 6 Frontispiece), is called the Arrhenius equation.

The overall reaction rate for the NO2(g) + CO(g) reaction will \\nthus be\\n\\nrate of reaction = k1[NO2]2\\n\\nwhich, in fact, is the experimentally observed rate law.

Some Reaction Mechanisms Have a Fast equilibrium Step\\nUntil this point we have discussed reactions occurring in one direction only. \\nHowever, in many cases both the forward and reverse reactions are significant. \\nFor example, the elementary reaction described by the equation\\n\\n N2O4(g)  \\nkf⇋\\n\\n     kr\\n 2 NO2(g) (18.10)\\n\\n\\n\\n661\\n\\nproceeds at an appreciable rate in both the forward direction and the reverse \\ndirection. We indicate this by writing two arrows in Equation 18.10. Because \\nEquation 18.10 represents an elementary reaction, the forward and reverse \\nreaction-rate laws are:\\n\\nrate of forward reaction = kf [N2O4]\\n\\nand\\n\\nrate of reverse reaction = kr[NO2]2\\n\\nwhere kf and kr are the forward and reverse reaction-rate constants, respectively.\\nIf the reaction is allowed to proceed, it will eventually reach a state of \\n\\nequilibrium where the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the \\nreverse reaction. (A discussion of equilibrium is the subject of our next chap-\\nter.) Under these conditions we can write\\n\\n  rate of forward reaction = rate of reverse reaction (at equilibrium) (18.11)\\n\\nThus, for the reaction at equilibrium, we have\\n\\n kf [N2O4] = kr[NO2]2 (at equilibrium) (18.12)\\n\\nMany mechanisms have a step involving an equilibrium and particularly an \\nequilibrium that is assumed to be established very rapidly. For example, let’s \\nconsider the reaction between nitrogen oxide and oxygen gas described by the \\nequation\\n\\n 2 NO(g) + O2(g) → 2 NO2(g) (18.13)\\n\\nThe rate law for this reaction has been determined experimentally to be\\n\\nrate of reaction = k[NO]2[O2]\\n\\nOne proposed mechanism for this reaction is\\n\\n(1)  2 NO(g)  k1⇋\\n     k–1\\n\\n N2O4(g) (fast equilibrium) (18.14)\\n\\n(2)  N2O4(g) + O2(g) \\uf8e7\\nk2\\n\\n → 2 NO2(g) (slow) (18.15)\\n\\nwhere k1 and k–1 are the forward and reverse rate constants for the first step \\nin the mechanism and k2 is the rate constant for the second step. We can see \\nthat this mechanism is consistent with the stoichiometry of the overall chemical \\nreaction by adding steps (1) and (2) and canceling the N2O4(g) intermediate \\nto obtain\\n\\n2 NO(g) + O2(g) → 2 NO2(g)\\n\\nwhich is Equation 18.13.\\nWhat we mean by “fast equilibrium” in the first step above is that both the \\n\\nforward and reverse rates are fast, so that the equilibrium is established very \\nrapidly. In particular, for our purposes, when an N2O4(g) molecule reacts with \\n\\n18-5. SOMe ReaCTIOn MeCHanISMS Have a FaST equILIBRIuM STeP\\n\\n\\n\\n18.

A sum-\\nmary of the properties of catalysts is given in Table 18.1.\\n\\nMost catalysts act by providing a new reaction pathway (or mechanism) with \\na lower activation energy than that of the uncatalyzed reaction.

Three-body encounters, or termolecular \\nreactions, are much less likely to occur than two-body encounters (bimolecular \\nreactions); for this reason, the reaction rate is low. The 2 Ce4+(aq) + Tl+(aq) \\nreaction is catalyzed by Mn2+(aq). The catalytic action of Mn2+(aq) has been \\nattributed to the availability of the Mn3+ and Mn4+ ionic states, which provide a \\nnew reaction pathway involving a three-step sequence of bimolecular elemen-\\ntary reactions as described by the equations\\n\\n→ Mn3+(aq) + Ce3+(aq)Ce4+(aq) + Mn2+(aq)(1)\\n\\n→ Mn4+(aq) + Ce3+(aq)Ce4+(aq) + Mn3+(aq)(2)\\n\\n→ Mn2+(aq) + Tl3+(aq)Tl+(aq) + Mn4+(aq)(3)\\n\\n(slow)\\n\\n(fast)\\n\\n(fast)\\n\\nThe sum of these three equations corresponds to the overall reaction stoichi-\\nometry and the Mn2+(aq) is not consumed in the process.

The Michaelis-Menten equation Describes the Rates of Many \\nenzyme-Catalyzed Reactions\\n\\nOne of the most important classes of catalyzed reactions consists of the biologi-\\ncal processes that involve enzymes. Enzymes are protein molecules that cata-\\nlyze specific biochemical reactions. Without enzymes, many of the reactions \\nnecessary to sustain life would occur at negligible rates and life as we know \\nit would not exist. The reactant molecule acted upon by an enzyme is called \\nthe substrate. The region of the enzyme where the substrate reacts is called \\nthe active site. The active site is only a small part of the enzyme molecule. For \\nexample, consider the enzyme hexokinase, which catalyzes the reaction of glu-\\ncose to glucose 6-phosphate according to the following equation:\\n\\nC C\\n\\nC\\n\\nC +  ATP\\nhexokinase\\n\\nOHOH\\n\\nOH\\n\\nglucose glucose 6-phosphate\\n\\nCH2OH\\n\\nHH\\n\\nH\\n\\nC\\n\\nO\\n\\nC C\\n\\nC\\n\\nC +  ADP + H+\\n\\nOHOH\\n\\nOH\\n\\nCH2OPO3\\n2–\\n\\nHH\\n\\nH\\n\\nOH\\nH\\n\\nHC\\n\\nO\\n\\nOH\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nThe essence of this reaction is the addition of a phosphate group (red) to the \\nglucose substrate, a process called phosphorylation in biochemistry. ATP (ade-\\nnosine triphosphate) and ADP (adenosine diphosphate) are molecules that the \\nbody uses to store and transfer energy in the form of phosphate bonds.\\n\\nFigure 18.10a shows a space-filling model of hexokinase. Typical of proteins, \\nit is a very large molecule with a molecular mass of about 50 000. We see that the \\nprotein has a cleft at its active site. The glucose molecule enters this cleft, and \\nthe protein closes around it (Figure 18.10b).\\n\\nExperimental studies reveal that the rate law for many enzyme-catalyzed \\nreactions has the form\\n\\nrate of reaction = R = =\\n∆[P]\\n—\\n\\n∆t\\nk[S]\\n—\\n[S] + KM\\n\\n (18.21)\\n\\nFigure 18.10 Space-filling model \\nof the two conformations of \\nhexokinase.

Figure 18.11 shows the dependence of the \\nrate, R, of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction on the substrate concentration. At low \\nsubstrate concentrations, the rate is proportional to [S] and is thus first order \\nwith respect to the substrate concentration. As the concentration of substrate is \\nincreased, the reaction rate levels off and attains a maximum value, Rmax. At these \\nconcentrations, the rate is independent of [S] and is thus zero order with respect to \\nthe substrate concentration. Physically, this means that there is so much substrate \\nrelative to the amount of enzyme present that the substrate must wait around \\nfor an active site to become available. In this range of substrate concentration, \\nthe enzyme is said to be saturated. The reaction rate is controlled by the (con-\\nstant) amount of enzyme and is independent of the amount of substrate present.\\n\\nLet’s see how Equation 18.21 is consistent with Figure 18.11. For small values of \\n[S], we can neglect [S] with respect to KM in the denominator of Equation 18.21, \\nin which case we have R = k[S]/KM, or that the reaction-rate law is first order in [S]. \\nFor large values of [S], we can neglect KM with respect to [S] to obtain R = k = Rmax. \\nThe reaction-rate law is zero order in [S] because the rate of the reaction is equal \\nto a constant. Thus, we see that Equation 18.21 is in accord with Figure 18.11.\\n\\nA simple mechanism that accounts for this rate law was first proposed by \\nLeonor Michaelis and Maude Menten (Frontispiece) in 1913. The Michaelis-\\nMenten mechanism is a two-step process that involves the formation of an inter-\\nmediate complex between the enzyme and the substrate, denoted by ES (such \\nas that depicted in Figure 18.10b) and can be represented by\\n\\n(1)    E + S   k1⇋\\n     k–1\\n\\n ES\\n\\n(2)    ES \\uf8e7k2 → E + P\\n\\nNote that the overall reaction is S → P. Also note that ES, the enzyme-substrate \\ncomplex, is an intermediate species in this mechanism. Unlike the reactions \\ndiscussed in Section 18-4 or 18-5, there is no rate-determining step, nor is there \\na fast equilibrium step indicated in the mechanism. Because ES is an intermedi-\\nate species and is very reactive, its concentration never builds up and so is small \\nthroughout the course of the reaction. This is especially true if the rate of step 2 \\nis greater than that of step 1. Consequentially, the concentration of ES is small \\nand essentially constant during the course of the reaction. Figure 18.12 shows \\nhow the concentration of free enzyme [E], substrate [S], enzyme-substrate \\ncomplex [ES], and product [P] vary with time. You can see that [S] decreases \\nand that [P] increases with time, but the concentration [ES] is essentially con-\\nstant after a very brief initial period. At this point, the concentration [ES] has \\nreached a steady state, in which ES is consumed as rapidly as it is formed. The \\namounts of E and ES in Figure 18.12 are greatly exaggerated for clarity. The \\nconcentration of enzyme and consequently that of the enzyme-substrate com-\\nplex are generally very small in enzyme-catalyzed reactions.\\n\\nThe rate of the overall reaction can be described by the rate of formation of \\nproduct, which we write as\\n\\n R = = k2[ES]\\n∆[P]\\n—\\n\\n∆t\\n (18.22)\\n\\nBecause ES is an intermediate species, we want to express [ES] in this equation \\nin terms of the concentration of the other species.\\n\\nR\\n\\nRmax\\n\\nKM\\n\\n1–\\n2Rmax\\n\\n0\\n0\\n\\nSubstrate concentration, [S]\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n11/24 /09\\n\\n018-011\\n\\nFigure 18.11 The effect of substrate \\nconcentration on the rate of an \\nenzyme-catalyzed reaction.

For this to be so, the rate of forma-\\ntion of ES must equal its rate of breakdown, and so we write\\n\\n k1[E][S] = (k–1 + k2)[ES] (steady-state approximation) (18.23)\\n\\nEquation 18.23 is called the steady-state approximation because it is based on \\nthe assumption that the rate at which ES is formed is equal to the rate at which \\nit is broken down and thus [ES] maintains a steady state value during the course \\nof the reaction (Figure 18.12). Solving Equation 18.23 for [ES] gives\\n\\n [ES] =\\nk1[E][S]—\\nk–1 + k2\\n\\n (18.24)\\n\\nWe can simplify Equation 18.24 by defining a new constant, called the Michaelis-\\nMenten constant,\\n\\n KM =\\nk–1 + k2—\\n\\nk1\\n (18.25)\\n\\nso that Equation 18.24 becomes\\n\\n [ES] =\\n[E][S]\\n—\\n\\nKM\\n (18.26)\\n\\nThe concentration of free enzyme, [E], in Equation 18.26 is not known; \\nonly the total concentration of enzyme, [E]t, is known. The total concentration \\nof enzyme is the sum of the concentration of free enzyme, [E], and that of the \\nenzyme-substrate complex [ES] (Figure 18.12). In an equation, we have\\n\\n [E]t = [E] + [ES] (18.27)\\n\\nIf we solve Equation 18.27 for [E] and substitute the result into Equation 18.26, \\nthen we obtain\\n\\n[ES] =\\n([E]t – [ES])[S]—\\n\\nKM\\n\\nSolving for [ES] gives\\n\\n[ES] =\\n[E]t[S]—\\n\\n[S] + KM\\n\\n\\n\\n671\\n\\nSubstituting this into Equation 18.22 gives us our final result\\n\\n R =\\nk2[E]t[S]—\\n[S] + KM\\n\\n (18.28)\\n\\nObserve that Equation 18.28 has the same form as the experimentally observed \\nrate law, Equation 18.21, where k = k2[E]t.\\n\\nWhen [S] >> KM, [S] + KM ≈ [S] and Equation 18.28 becomes\\n\\n R = = k2[E]t\\nk2[E]t[S]—\\n\\n[S]\\n (18.29)\\n\\nBecause the substrate concentration is so high under these conditions, essen-\\ntially all the enzyme in the system is present as the ES complex, and so the rate \\nof the reaction is a maximum (in accord with Figure 18.11). Thus, we find that\\n\\n Rmax = k2[E]t (18.30)\\n\\nwhere Rmax is the maximum rate of the reaction. We point out that this expres-\\nsion is zero order in [S], in that the rate of the reaction is equal to a constant. \\nUsing this result, Equation 18.28 can be written in the form\\n\\n R =\\nRmax[S]—\\n[S] + KM\\n\\n (18.31)\\n\\nNotice that R = 1–2Rmax when KM = [S] as shown in Figure 18.11. Thus, we see that \\nthe Michaelis-Menten constant, KM, is the value of [S] for which R = \\n\\n1–\\n2Rmax.\\n\\nWhen working with experimental data, it is always convenient to deal with \\nstraight lines. Equation 18.31 can be cast as a straight line by taking its recipro-\\ncal and writing it as\\n\\n = +�� ��KM—Rmax \\n1\\n\\n—\\nRmax \\n\\n1\\n—\\nR \\n\\n1\\n—\\n[S]\\n\\n (18.32)\\n\\nEquation 18.32 is called the Lineweaver-Burk equation.

Such a plot, called a Lineweaver-Burk plot, is shown in Figure 18.13. \\nThe value of Rmax depends upon the total enzyme concentration, but the \\nvalue of KM is characteristic of the enzyme itself. One of the many uses of the \\nMichaelis-Menten constant is for the quantitative assay of enzyme activity in tis-\\nsues and in enzyme purification.

In \\nthis case, the rate law can be deduced from the reaction stoichiometry. Most \\nchemical reactions are not elementary reactions, so their rate laws cannot \\nbe deduced from the reaction stoichiometry. The reaction mechanism is the \\nsequence of elementary reactions by which reactants are converted to prod-\\nucts. A reaction mechanism that involves more than one elementary reaction \\nnecessarily involves reaction intermediates. An intermediate is a species that \\nis formed from the reactants and is involved in the conversion of reactants to \\nproducts but does not appear in the overall reaction equation.\\n\\nIn order to react, molecules have to collide. However, only those collisions in \\nwhich the molecules have the correct orientation and have a combined energy \\nequal to or greater than the activation energy for the reaction lead to products. \\nThe temperature dependence of a rate constant is given by the Arrhenius equa-\\ntion (Equation 18.7).\\n\\nTwo devices that help us write the rate law for an overall reaction are the pos-\\nsibility of a rate-determining step and that of a fast equilibrium step. If either of \\nthese occurs in a mechanism, then it is generally straight forward to write the \\nrate law for the overall reaction.\\n\\nA catalyst is a species that increases the rate of a reaction but is not con-\\nsumed as a reactant.

Depending on the collision rate \\n\\n\\n\\nPROBLeMS 683\\n\\nin the gas and the lag time between a collision and \\nthe subsequent reaction, the molecule could possibly \\nundergo a deactivating bimolecular collision before it \\nhas a chance to react.

(*) This problem explores the connection \\nbetween the observed activation parameters for a \\nchemical reaction and the activation parameters \\nof the individual steps of the reaction mechanism. \\nSpecifically, suppose that the rate constant for each \\nstep of the Lindemann mechanism in the previous \\nproblem shows Arrhenius behavior.

Peter Waage (1833–1900), right, was born on the island of Hitter (now \\nHidra) near Flekkefjord, Norway, the son of a shipmaster. Guldberg and Waage \\nboth entered the University of Christiania in 1854, forming a lifelong friendship. \\nWhile undergraduates, they helped form a club to discuss problems of physics and \\nchemistry. Guldberg majored in mathematics with a minor in physics and chemistry \\nand later became a professor of applied mathematics at the University of Christiania. \\nWaage studied medicine, but then switched to mineralogy and chemistry in his \\nthird year, eventually becoming chair of the chemistry department at Christiania. \\nGuldberg and Waage were related through two marriages. Guldberg married \\nhis cousin Bodil Riddervold and Waage married her sister Johanne Riddervold, \\nmaking the two friends brothers-in-law. After Johanne’s death in 1869, Waage \\nmarried Guldberg’s sister, Mathilde, making them brothers-in-law for a second \\ntime. Together they published a series of papers that became the foundation of our \\nmodern theory of equilibrium.

They showed that a chemical reaction takes \\nplace in both the forward and reverse directions simultaneously. As a reaction \\nproceeds (from reactants to products), the rate of the forward reaction slows \\ndown. Meanwhile, as the concentration of products builds up, the rate of the \\nreverse reaction (from products to reactants) increases, until the rate of the \\nreverse reaction equals that of the forward reaction. When that happens, the \\nreaction appears to have stopped. No more reactant disappears, and no more \\nproduct appears. Nevertheless, on a molecular scale reactant molecules con-\\ntinue to react to produce product molecules, and product molecules continue \\nto react to produce reactant molecules, but the concentrations of reactants and \\nproducts no longer change. The system has reached a state of equilibrium.\\n\\nSo far we have usually assumed that chemical reactions go in one direction, \\nforward from reactants to products. However, as we shall see, this is really a \\nspecial case in which the equilibrium state lies so far to the product side that it \\nappears as if the reaction runs in only one direction.\\n\\nIf we prepare a mixture of reactants and products, in what direction does \\nthe reaction proceed toward equilibrium and what are the final concentrations? \\nIf conditions then change, disturbing the equilibrium, in which direction does \\nthe reaction shift? In this chapter, we show how to answer these questions. We \\nshow that a chemical reaction at a given temperature is characterized by a quan-\\ntity called an equilibrium constant. By studying reaction systems at equilibrium, \\nwe determine how to maximize the amount of a desired product.\\n\\n\\n\\n19. CHEmiCal Equilibrium686\\n\\n19-1. a Chemical Equilibrium is a Dynamic Equilibrium\\nConsider the chemical reaction described by the equation\\n\\nN2O4(g) ⇌ 2 NO2(g) (19.1)\\ncolorless brown\\n\\nin which the colorless gas dinitrogen tetroxide, N2O4(g), dissociates into \\nthe reddish-brown gas nitrogen dioxide, NO2(g). As we discussed briefly in \\nSection 18-5, the reaction described by Equation 19.1, like all chemical reac-\\ntions, is really two opposing reactions. The forward reaction is the dissocia-\\ntion of N2O4(g) molecules into NO2(g) molecules, and the reverse reaction is \\nthe association of NO2(g) molecules into N2O4(g) molecules. We recognize the \\nexistence of both a forward reaction and reverse reaction by separating the two \\nsides of Equation 19.1 by two arrows pointing in opposite directions.\\n\\nSuppose that we start with only N2O4(g). Initially, the reaction mixture is \\ncolorless. As N2O4(g) molecules dissociate into NO2(g) molecules, the mixture \\nbecomes reddish-brown. As the concentration of NO2(g) increases, more and \\nmore NO2(g) molecules collide and associate back into N2O4(g) molecules. Thus, \\nthe reverse rate of the process described by Equation 19.1 increases with time. \\nAs N2O4(g) molecules dissociate, there are fewer N2O4(g) molecules remaining, \\nso the forward rate decreases. Eventually, the forward rate and the reverse rate \\nbecome equal and a state of chemical equilibrium exists (Figure 19.1). At equilib-\\nrium, the concentrations of N2O4(g) and NO2(g) no longer change with time. A \\nchemical equilibrium is a dynamic equilibrium because N2O4(g) molecules are \\nstill dissociating into NO2(g) molecules and NO2(g) molecules are still associat-\\ning into N2O4(g) molecules. The rates of these two processes are exactly the same, \\nhowever, so there is no net change in the concentrations of N2O4(g) and NO2(g).\\n\\nWe can perform a simple demonstration to prove that a chemical equilibrium \\nis dynamic. When calcium carbonate, CaCO3(s), is heated in a closed container, it \\ndecomposes to calcium oxide, CaO(s), and carbon dioxide, CO2(g), according to\\n\\n CaCO3(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO2(g) (19.2)\\n\\nEventually, the rate of the reverse reaction will equal the rate of the forward \\nreaction, and a state of equilibrium results. At equilibrium, the pressure of the \\ncarbon dioxide will be constant (Figure 19.2). Suppose now that we add a small \\namount of calcium carbonate containing radioactive carbon to the equilibrium \\nmixture. We denote this calcium carbonate by Ca*CO3(s) to emphasize that \\nthe carbon atoms are radioactive. After we add the Ca*CO3(s), we observe that \\nthe pressure of the CO2(g) does not change, an observation indicating that the \\nequilibrium state, the concentration of each of the species present at equilib-\\nrium, has not been disturbed. Yet the radioactivity, which can be measured with \\nan instrument such as a Geiger counter, does not  remain solely in the calcium \\ncarbonate. In time, some of the radioactivity is observed in the carbon dioxide \\n(Figure 19.3). If a chemical equilibrium were a static equilibrium, then the \\nradioactivity would remain in the calcium carbonate phase. It gets distributed \\nbetween the calcium carbonate and the carbon dioxide, however, because the \\nequilibrium is a dynamic equilibrium. Both the forward and the reverse reac-\\ntions in Equation 19.2 occur constantly, but at exactly the same rate, so there is \\nno net  change.\\n\\nForward reaction rate\\nN2O4 � 2 NO2\\n\\nReverse reaction rate\\n2 NO2 � N2O4\\n\\nR\\nat\\n\\ne\\n\\nEquilibrium\\nattained\\n\\nTime\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/31/09\\n\\n019-001 (595)\\n\\nTime\\n\\nP C\\nO\\n\\n2\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n08/31/09\\n\\n019-002 (596)\\n\\nFigure 19.1 Dinitrogen tetroxide, \\nN2O4(g), injected into an empty vessel \\nwill dissociate according to\\n\\nN2O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)\\n\\nAs the N2O4(g) dissociates, its concen-\\ntration decreases, so the rate of the for-\\nward reaction decreases (red curve). \\nAs the concentration of NO2(g) builds \\nup, the rate of the reverse reaction \\nincreases (blue curve).

Equilibrium values of [N2O4] and [NO2] for several sets of initial con-\\nditions are given in Table 19.1. The most remarkable feature of the data in \\nTable 19.1 is shown in the last column. The value of the ratio [NO2]2/[N2O4] at \\nequilibrium for the reaction described by\\n\\nN2O4(g) ⇌ 2 NO2(g)\\n\\nis equal to a constant. From the data in Table 19.1, we see that\\n\\n \\n[NO2]2\\n—\\n[N2O4] \\n\\n(at equilibrium at 100°C)= 0.20 M  (19.3)\\n\\n\\n\\n19-3.  tHE Equilibrium Constant For a CHEmiCal Equation 689\\n\\nFor example, if we know that [NO2] = 0.175 M at equilibrium, then [N2O4] \\nwould have to be 0.15 M so that [NO2]2/[N2O4] equals 0.20 M. Table 19.1 shows \\nthat the constant value of [NO2]2/[N2O4] at equilibrium is independent of the \\ninitial values, [N2O4]0 and [NO2]0. It does not matter whether we start our reac-\\ntion with only N2O4(g), with only NO2(g), or with a mixture of both; in all \\ncases, the value of the ratio [NO2]2/[N2O4] at equilibrium is the same. These \\ndata show that a chemical equilibrium can be attained from either direction.\\n\\n19-3.  the Equilibrium Constant for a Chemical Equation is Equal \\nto the ratio of Product Concentration terms to reactant \\nConcentration terms\\n\\nFor the N2O4(g)-NO2(g) reaction (Equation 19.1), we found that regardless of \\nthe initial concentrations of N2O4(g) and NO2(g), Equation 19.3 is satisfied at \\nequilibrium. Equation 19.3 says that the ratio of equilibrium product concen-\\ntration to equilibrium reactant concentration, each raised to a power equal to \\nits balancing coefficient in the chemical equation for the reaction, is a constant \\nvalue at a given temperature, regardless of the initial concentrations of the reac-\\ntants and products.

Notice that the concen-\\ntration of C(s) does not appear in Equation 19.4. The concentration of a pure \\nliquid or a pure solid can be expressed by its density, but the densities of pure \\nliquids and pure solids do not vary much with temperature or pressure and so \\nare essentially constant. Consequently, they contribute only a constant factor to \\nthe equilibrium constant. By convention, we set this factor equal to one so that \\n[C] does not appear in Equation 19.4.\\n\\nThe general pattern was first deduced by two Norwegian chemists, Cato \\nGuldberg and Peter Waage (Frontispiece). On the basis of their experimental \\nobservations of a number of chemical reactions, they postulated that for the \\nbalanced general chemical equation\\n\\na  A(g) + b B(soln) + c  C(s) ⇌ x  X(g) + y Y(soln) + z  Z(l )\\n\\nthe ratio\\n\\n \\n[X]x[Y]y \\n—\\n[A]a[B]b \\n\\n (19.5)\\n\\nis a constant at a given temperature. Once again, notice that the concentrations \\nof the solid and liquid species do not appear in Equation 19.5. We call the con-\\nstant ratio in Equation 19.5 an equilibrium constant, Kc, and write\\n\\n \\n[X]x[Y]y \\n—\\n[A]a[B]b \\n\\nKc =  (19.6)\\n\\nEquation 19.6 is the mathematical form of the equilibrium-constant \\nexpression. The subscript c indicates that the equilibrium constant is expressed \\nin terms of concentrations. We shall soon show that we can also express equi-\\nlibrium constants involving gaseous species in terms of pressures. In that case, \\nwe write Kp instead of Kc. Equation 19.6 was originally deduced experimentally, \\nbut later the same type of expression was derived theoretically using thermo-\\ndynamic concepts that we shall discuss in Chapter 23.

If, for instance, we had chosen to describe the reaction of \\nN2O4(g) as\\n\\n\\n\\n19-3.  tHE Equilibrium Constant For a CHEmiCal Equation 691\\n\\n 1–2  N2O4(g) ⇌ NO2(g) (19.9)\\n\\ninstead of by Equation 19.7, then we would have\\n\\n \\n[NO2]\\n—\\n[N2O4] 1 ⁄ 2 \\n\\nK ′c =  (19.10)\\n\\nNote that Equations 19.8 and 19.10 differ by a square root, so that the value  \\nof K ′c is\\n\\n K ′c = K c1/2 = (0.20 M)1/2 = 0.45 M1/2 (19.11)\\n\\nWe have shown that there is no such thing as an equilibrium constant for a \\nreaction. There is only an equilibrium constant for the chemical equation that \\nis used to represent a reaction. We shall see more examples of this in Section \\n19-6. We learned in Chapter 14 that the values of thermochemical quantities \\nalso depend upon how we choose to write the chemical equation that repre-\\nsents a reaction. In Chapter 23 we shall see a nice relation between thermo-\\nchemical quantities and equilibrium constants for a given chemical equation.\\n\\nNote that the equilibrium constants in Equations 19.3, 19.4, and 19.11 clearly \\nhave units, in accord with the recommendation of the International Union of \\nPure and Applied Chemistry. When we study thermodynamics in Chapter 23, \\nwe shall define a more fundamental equilibrium constant, K (without a  sub-\\nscript), called a thermodynamic equilibrium constant, that is related to Kc and \\nKp but is unitless. In this chapter, however, all our equilibrium constants will \\nhave units because their defining expressions have units.\\n\\nThe important points to know about equilibrium-constant expressions are:\\n\\n 1.  The value of Kc or Kp for a stated chemical equation is equal to a constant \\nat a given temperature.\\n\\n 2.

Because the initial concentration of \\nCO(g) is 1.75 M and its equilibrium value is 1.60 M, we see that the change \\nin the concentration of CO(g) is simply the difference between these two \\nvalues, or 0.15 M.

Therefore, a reaction equilibrium in which there is much \\nmore product than reactant will typically have a large value of Kc. For example, \\nat 1200°C the value of Kc for the reaction described by\\n\\nH2(g) + Cl2(g) ⇌ 2 HCl(g)\\n\\nis 2.5 × 104.

Equilibrium Constants Can be Expressed in terms of Partial \\nPressures\\n\\nFor reactions involving only gases, it is often convenient to express the equi-\\nlibrium constant in terms of partial pressures rather than concentrations. An \\nequilibrium-constant expression written in terms of partial pressures is denoted \\nby Kp. For example, the K p expression for the equation\\n\\nCaCO3(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO2(g)\\n\\nis Kp = PCO2. Note once again that solids and liquids do not appear in the equi-\\nlibrium constant expression.\\n\\nBecause Kp is a constant (at a given temperature), the equilibrium pressure \\nof CO2(g) is the same, regardless of the amount of CaCO3(s) or CaO(s) present. \\nThis effect is illustrated in Figure 19.4.\\n\\nFor most chemical equations, Kp ≠ Kc.

Often a change in \\nconditions will displace the reaction from equilibrium. The reaction then shifts \\ntoward one direction or the other (left to right or right to left as the equation \\nis written) as it proceeds to a new equilibrium state. Henri Le Châtelier (pro-\\nnounced luh shat′elyay), a French physical chemist, was the first to explain how \\nto predict the direction of the shift (Figure 19.5). We do not need to know the \\nnumerical value of the equilibrium constant or perform calculations to apply \\nLe Châtelier’s principle, that can be stated as follows:\\n\\nIf a chemical reaction at equilibrium is subjected to a change in conditions that \\ndisplaces it from equilibrium, then the reaction adjusts toward a new equilibrium \\nstate. The reaction proceeds in the direction that—at least partially—offsets the \\nchange in conditions.\\n\\nThe quantities whose change may affect a reaction equilibrium are\\n\\n 1. concentration of a reactant or product\\n 2. reaction volume or applied pressure\\n 3. temperature\\n\\nAlthough Le Châtelier’s principle sounds imposing, it is actually simple to apply. \\nA key point to recognize is that the value of the equilibrium constant depends \\nonly on the temperature; it does not change when the reactant or product con-\\ncentrations, the reaction volume, or the applied pressure is changed.\\n\\nConsider the reaction equilibrium described by the equation\\n\\nC(s) + CO2(g) ⇌ 2 CO(g)\\n\\nIf we disturb the equilibrium by injecting some additional CO2(g) into the \\nreaction vessel, then the concentration of CO2(g) is increased. In response to \\nthe change in conditions, the reaction equilibrium shifts from left to right, \\n\\nFigure 19.5 Henri Le Châtelier \\n(1850–1936), a French chemist, \\nreceived his training in chemistry \\nand mathematics from his father, an \\naccomplished engineer who helped to \\nestablish France’s aluminum industry. \\nHis mother was a strong disciplinarian \\nand a devout Catholic from Italy \\nwho fostered in him a strong sense \\nof order and discipline. Despite his \\ntraining in engineering, Le Châtelier \\nchose to pursue an academic career \\nin chemistry, investigating the nature \\nof ceramics, cements, and alloys.

Thus, a decrease in volume has the same effect as \\nan increase in applied pressure and vice versa. For instance, in Example 19-10, \\nLe Châtelier’s principle says that we should decrease the pressure on the reac-\\ntion system in order to produce more CO(g). A decrease in the applied pres-\\nsure is equivalent to an increase in the reaction volume.\\n\\nChanges in external pressure can significantly affect even equilibria involv-\\ning only solids and liquids. The conversion between diamond and graphite, \\nthe two allotropic forms of carbon (Figure 19.10), illustrates this application \\nof Le Châtelier’s principle. Graphite is the stable form at ordinary pressures, \\nwhereas diamond is the stable form at high pressures, such as thousands of \\nbars. The molar volume of graphite is 5.5 cm3∙mol−1, and the molar volume of \\ndiamond is 3.4 cm3∙mol−1. When a pressure in excess of about 15 000 bars is \\napplied to graphite, some of the effect of the pressure can be relieved by con-\\nverting graphite to diamond, which has a smaller molar volume. This effect also \\nexplains why ice floats on water (Figure 19.11) and melts under pressure: liquid \\nwater has a smaller molar volume than ice.\\n\\nLet’s now consider the effect of a change in temperature upon a reaction at \\nequilibrium. The value of an equilibrium constant varies with temperature. For \\nsome reactions, the value of the equilibrium constant increases with increasing \\ntemperature, whereas for others it decreases. Let’s first consider the endother-\\nmic reaction described by\\n\\nN2O4(g) ⇌ 2 NO2(g)  DH°rxn = +55.3 kJ∙mol–1\\n colorless brown\\n\\nThis reaction requires the input of energy as heat, so we can write the equation \\nfor the reaction as\\n\\nN2O4(g) + 55.3 kJ∙mol–1 ⇌ 2 NO2(g)\\n\\nor simply\\n\\nN2O4(g) + heat ⇌ 2 NO2(g)\\n\\nSuppose now that we increase the temperature, making more energy as heat \\navailable.

The left-to-right \\nshift produces an increase in the equilibrium concentration of NO2(g) in the \\nsystem.

Thus, Le Châtelier’s principle tells us that the equilibrium shifts from \\nright to left, thereby producing an increase in the pressure of O2(g).

CHEmiCal Equilibrium712\\n\\nThus, an increase in temperature favors the conversion of products back to \\nreactants; that is, the equilibrium shifts from right to left when the temperature \\nis increased. The equilibrium constant decreases with increasing temperature, \\nas shown in Table 19.4. Thus, at a given total pressure the percentage conversion \\nof nitrogen and hydrogen to ammonia decreases  as the temperature increases.\\n\\nThe application of Le Châtelier’s principle to the ammonia synthesis reac-\\ntion leads to the prediction that at equilibrium  the yield of ammonia is greater \\nthe higher the total pressure and the lower the temperature. However, the \\nrate of the reaction at 25°C is negligibly slow. A high yield is of no commercial \\nvalue if it takes forever to achieve conversion. Because the rate of most reac-\\ntions increases with increasing temperature, the ammonia production reaction \\nis run at an elevated temperature (500°C), even though the equilibrium yield is \\nnot as favorable as at lower temperatures. In order to make the process econom-\\nically feasible, the low value of Kp at 500°C is offset by using a very high pressure \\n(300 bar), as shown in Table 19.5. The Haber process is thus based on a compro-\\nmise between equilibrium (yield) and rate (speed of reaction) considerations.\\n\\n19-8. le Châtelier’s Principle Has a quantitative basis\\nWe can discuss the changes predicted by Le Châtelier’s principle quantitatively. \\nFor example, consider the high-temperature reaction given by\\n\\nCO2(g) + H2(g) ⇌ CO(g) + H2O(g)\\n\\nSuppose that at equilibrium the concentrations are [CO2] = 0.075 M, [H2] = \\n0.060 M, [CO] = 0.100 M, and [H2O] = 0.025 M. Now suppose that additional \\nCO2(g) is injected into the mixture and its concentration suddenly jumps \\nto 0.125 M. What will be the concentration of each gas when equilibrium is \\nreestablished?\\n\\nWe can calculate the value of the equilibrium constant from the first set of \\nequilibrium concentrations:\\n\\n [CO][H2O] \\n—\\n[CO2][H2] \\n\\n(0.100 M)(0.025 M)\\n—\\n(0.075 M)(0.060 M)\\n\\nKc = = = 0.56\\n\\nTo determine the new equilibrium concentrations, we must set up a concen-\\ntration table. From Le Châtelier’s principle, we know that the position of the \\nequilibrium will shift to the right in order to offset the change caused by the \\naddition of the CO2(g). Thus, some CO2(g) and H2(g) will react to produce \\nequivalent amounts of CO(g) and H2O(g).

He was a high-strung boy who found refuge in his \\nschoolwork. He first studied medicine at the University of Copenhagen, but \\nsoon changed to chemistry, graduating in 1881. He received his Ph.D. doing \\nresearch in inorganic chemistry at the Technical University of Denmark \\nin Copenhagen. In 1901, he was invited to be the head of the chemical \\ndepartment of the Carlsberg Laboratory, which had been established by \\nJ. C. Jacobsen, the founder of the Carlsberg Brewery in Copenhagen in 1876. \\nThe laboratory was a renowned center of research in biochemistry and later \\nsupported the work of Niels Bohr and his institute in the development of the \\nquantum theory.\\n\\nWhen Sørensen joined the Carlsberg Laboratory, he continued his \\nstudies in protein chemistry and was later assisted by his second wife, \\nMargrethe Hoyrup Sørensen. He soon realized that the aqueous hydrogen \\nion concentration was critical to the function of most proteins, especially \\nenzymes. At that time, there was no convenient way to determine and express \\nthe concentration of the hydrogen ion. In addition, the wide range of its \\nconcentration, from about 1 M to 10–14 M, was numerically inconvenient. He \\ndevised the seemingly simple method of expressing the hydrogen ion scale \\non a logarithmic scale, which he called the PH scale—now called pH. The \\nletters pH are an abbreviation for “pondus hydrogenii” (potential hydrogen). \\nHis pH scale was quickly adopted by chemists because of its convenience. \\nThe use of pH became routine in laboratories when Arnold Beckman \\nintroduced the portable pH meter in 1935.\\n\\nThe concept of pH is so ingrained in us that it is difficult to appreciate \\nthe importance of Sørensen’s contribution. At the time, there was no way \\nto conveniently express the acidity of a solution, although it had become \\nincreasingly clear that some sort of expression was desperately needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n729\\n\\n20.

In this chapter, we first present a definition of acids and bases incor-\\nporating the key role that water plays in acid-base chemistry. Then we introduce \\nthe concept of pH that is a convenient measure of the acidity of a solution. We \\nshall show that acids and bases can be classified as either strong or weak. A cen-\\ntral, quantitative theme of this chapter is the calculation of the acidity, or pH, \\nof an acidic or a basic solution as a function of the concentration of the acid or \\nbase. We shall learn that solutions of salts can be acidic, basic, or neutral.\\n\\n20-1.  An Acid Is a Proton Donor and a Base Is a Proton Acceptor\\nIn Chapter 10 we defined an acid as a substance that produces H+(aq) ions in \\naqueous solution and a base as a substance that produces OH−(aq) ions in aque-\\nous solution. For example, we write the equations\\n\\nHCl(aq) → H+(aq) + Cl–(aq)\\n\\nand\\n\\nNaOH(aq) → Na+(aq) + OH–(aq)\\n\\nas expressions of the acidic nature of hydrochloric acid, HCl(aq), and the basic \\nnature of sodium hydroxide, NaOH(aq). We noted that acidic solutions taste \\nsour (for example, vinegar and lemon juice) and that basic solutions feel slip-\\npery and taste bitter (for example, soap and ammonia).\\n\\nThe definitions of acids and bases that we have used up to now are due to \\nArrhenius (Chapter 6 Frontispiece), and substances like HCl(aq) and NaOH(aq) \\n\\n\\n\\n20. The ProPerTIeS of AcIDS AnD BASeS730\\n\\nare called Arrhenius acids and bases. The Arrhenius definition of acids and \\nbases is limited to aqueous solutions, however. Although most of the reac-\\ntions in solution that we study in general chemistry take place in aqueous solu-\\ntion, many important reactions take place in other solvents, such as ethanol, \\nCH3CH2OH(l ), acetone, (CH3)2CO(l ), or ammonia NH3(l ). In this chapter we \\nuse a more general definition of acids and bases, based on the classification \\nscheme proposed independently by the Danish chemist Johannes Brønsted and \\nthe English chemist Thomas Lowry. Their definition emphasizes the role of the \\nsolvent in acid-base systems.\\n\\nUp to now we have generally used H+(aq) to represent the species formed \\nwhen an acid is dissolved in water. Experiments show, however, that the proton \\nis bonded to a water molecule (recall that H+ is often referred to as a proton), so \\na more accurate representation of the species present is H3O+(aq). This species \\nis called the hydronium ion and has the trigonal pyramidal structure shown in \\nFigure 20.1. The H3O+(aq) notation also tells us that the hydronium ion is fur-\\nther solvated by other water molecules that are represented by the symbol (aq). \\nThe equation that represents the acidic nature of HCl(aq) in the Brønsted-\\nLowry sense is\\n\\nHCl(aq) + H2O(l ) → H3O+(aq) + Cl−(aq)\\n\\nNote that the role of the solvent is explicitly included.\\nIn this system, we define Brønsted-Lowry acids as proton donors, and \\n\\nBrønsted-Lowry bases as proton acceptors. In our example, HCl(aq) is said to \\nbe a Brønsted-Lowry acid because it donates a proton to the solvent H2O(l ) to \\nproduce a hydronium ion. The H2O(l ) functions as a Brønsted-Lowry base in \\naccepting a proton from HCl(aq).\\n\\nA reaction involving the transfer of a proton from one molecule to another \\nis called a proton-transfer reaction or a protonation reaction. Acid-base reac-\\ntions are proton transfer reactions.\\n\\nAn even more general theory of acids and bases was put forth by G. N. Lewis \\nin 1923 (Chapter 7 Frontispiece). In this system, a Lewis acid is defined as an \\nelectron-pair acceptor and a Lewis base is defined as an electron-pair donor. \\nThese more general definitions of an acid and a base include both the Arrhenius \\nand Brønsted-Lowry definitions. For example, the reaction of HCl with water,\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nHH O ClCl\\n\\nLewis base\\n(electron-pair\\n\\ndonor)\\n\\nLewis acid\\n(electron-pair\\n\\nacceptor)\\n\\nO HH ++\\n–\\n\\n+\\n\\nmay also be viewed as the donation of one of the lone pairs of electrons in the \\nH2O molecule to the hydrogen atom in the HCl molecule, which in turn accepts \\nthe lone pair to form the products. Thus, in this reaction H2O(l ) acts as a Lewis \\nbase and HCl(aq) acts as a Lewis acid.\\n\\nBecause the Lewis definition of acids and bases is more general than that \\nof Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry, there are many reactions that may be consid-\\nered to be acid-base reactions in the Lewis sense that would not be in, say, the \\nBrønsted-Lowry sense. For example, consider the reaction between ammonia \\nand boron trifluoride:\\n\\nfigure 20.1 The hydronium ion has \\na trigonal pyramidal shape. All the \\noxygen-hydrogen bond lengths are \\nidentical (106 pm) and all the H–O–H \\nbond angles are identical (110°).

Note that BF3 is \\nnot an acid in the Brønsted-Lowry sense because it does not donate a proton, \\nbut it is a Lewis acid because it acts as an electron-pair acceptor. In general, an \\nelectron-deficient species (Section 7-7) can act as a Lewis acid, and a species \\nwith a lone pair of electrons can act as a Lewis base.\\n\\nThe Lewis acid-base classification scheme is especially useful in understand-\\ning the mechanisms of organic chemical reactions. However, the Brønsted-\\nLowry classification system is more convenient in most of the cases that we shall \\nconsider here.\\n\\n20-2.  In an Aqueous Solution the Product of the Ion \\nconcentrations [h3o+] and [oh–] Is a constant\\n\\nPure water contains a small number of hydronium ions, H3O+(aq), and hydrox-\\nide ions, OH−(aq), that arise from the equilibrium\\n\\n H2O(l ) + H2O(l ) ⇌ H3O+(aq) + OH−(aq) (20.1)\\n\\nIn terms of Lewis formulas, this reaction can be represented as follows:\\n\\nH\\n\\nH\\n\\nH H\\n\\nH\\n\\nO OH O\\n\\nH\\n\\nH O ++\\n–+\\n\\nIn this reaction, a water molecule transfers a proton to another water molecule. \\nThus, water acts both as an acid (proton donor) and as a base (proton accep-\\ntor) in the Brønsted-Lowry system. The reaction described by Equation 20.1 is \\ncalled an autoprotonation reaction.\\n\\nThe equilibrium-constant expression for Equation 20.1 is\\n\\n Kw = [H3O+][OH−] (20.2)\\n\\nwhere the subscript w refers to water. Note that the concentration of water does \\nnot appear in the Kw expression because the water is a liquid and the value \\nof [H2O] is effectively constant in aqueous solutions (Section 19-3). The equi-\\nlibrium constant Kw is called the ion-product constant of water. At 25°C the \\nexperimental value of Kw is\\n\\n Kw = [H3O+][OH−] = 1.0 × 10–14 M2 (20.3)\\n\\nThis small value of Kw means that in pure water the concentrations of \\nH3O+(aq) and OH−(aq) are low; that is, the equilibrium represented by \\nEquation 20.1 lies far to the left. From the stoichiometry of Equation 20.1 we \\nnote that if we start with pure water, then H3O+(aq) and OH−(aq) are produced \\non a one-for-one basis. Therefore, in pure water  we have the equality\\n\\n\\n\\n20. The ProPerTIeS of AcIDS AnD BASeS732\\n\\n[H3O+] = [OH−]\\n\\nUsing this equation to eliminate [OH−] in Equation 20.3 yields\\n\\n[H3O+]2 = 1.0 × 10–14 M2\\n\\nTaking the square root of both sides yields\\n\\n[H3O+] = 1.0 × 10–7 M\\n\\nBecause [H3O+] = [OH−], we conclude that\\n\\n[OH−] = 1.0 × 10–7 M\\n\\nThus, both [H3O+] and [OH−] are equal to 1.0 × 10−7 M in pure water at 25°C. \\nAlthough [H3O+] = [OH−] for pure water, this is not necessarily true when sub-\\nstances are dissolved in the water. We have the following classification:\\n\\nA neutral aqueous solution is defined as one in which\\n\\n[H3O+] = [OH−]  (neutral solution)\\n\\nAn acidic aqueous solution is defined as one in which\\n\\n[H3O+] > [OH−]  (acidic solution)\\n\\nA basic aqueous solution is defined as one in which\\n\\n[OH−] > [H3O+]  (basic solution)\\n\\n20-3.  Strong Acids and Strong Bases Are completely Dissociated in \\nAqueous Solutions\\n\\nWe noted in Section 12-3 that aqueous solutions of electrolytes conduct an elec-\\ntric current. The electrical conductance is proportional to the number of ions \\nthat are available to conduct a current. Conductivity measurements on dilute \\nHCl(aq) solutions show that the HCl molecules in the solution are completely \\ndissociated, forming H3O+(aq) and Cl−(aq) ions. There are essentially no undis-\\nsociated HCl molecules in aqueous solution. Acids that are completely dissoci-\\nated are referred to as strong acids. The term strong  refers to the ability of such \\nacids to donate protons to water molecules.

(Note that these are the \\nfirst two classes of strong electrolytes listed in Section 12-3.) You should memo-\\nrize their formulas because this information is essential in working problems in \\nacid-base chemistry. Three of the six strong acids are halogen acids: HCl(aq), \\nHBr(aq), and HI(aq). Five of the nine strong bases are alkali metal hydrox-\\nides: LiOH(aq), NaOH(aq), KOH(aq), RbOH(aq), and CsOH(aq). Another \\nthree of the strong bases are alkaline-earth metal hydroxides: Ca(OH)2(aq), \\nSr(OH)2(aq), and Ba(OH)2(aq). Unlike the other halogen acids, HF(aq) is a \\nweak acid because it has a much stronger bond than the H–X bonds in the \\nother halogen acids (Table 20.2).\\n\\nWe can use the data in Table 20.1 to understand why certain salts form \\nneutral solutions. For example, when NaCl(s) is dissolved in water, the result \\nis a neutral solution. That is, [H3O+] = [OH–], even though both Na+(aq) and \\nCl–(aq) ions are present in the water. Let’s first examine the Cl–(aq) anion. This \\nis the anion present in the strong acid HCl(aq). Because HCl(aq) is a strong \\nacid, it dissociates completely in water according to\\n\\nHCl(aq) + H2O(l ) → H3O+(aq) + Cl–(aq)\\n\\nwhere we have used a right-hand arrow to show that there are essentially no \\nundissociated HCl(aq) molecules present in aqueous solution. Thus, Cl–(aq) \\nhas no tendency to undergo a proton transfer reaction with water. That is, the \\nreaction described by\\n\\nCl–(aq) + H2O(l ) → HCl(aq) + OH–(aq) (does not occur)\\n\\ndoes not occur to any significant extent because the products of this reaction \\nimmediately react to re-form Cl–(aq) and water. Thus, we say that Cl–(aq) ions \\nare neutral in water (in the acid-base sense, not the electrical sense).\\n\\nTABLe 20.1 Strong acids and strong bases in water\\n\\nStrong acids Strong bases\\n\\nFormula Name Formula Name\\n\\nHClO4\\n\\nHNO3\\n\\nH2SO4\\n\\nHCl\\n\\nHBr\\n\\nHI\\n\\nperchloric acid\\n\\nnitric acid\\n\\nsulfuric acid*\\n\\nhydrochloric acid\\n\\nhydrobromic acid\\n\\nhydroiodic acid\\n\\nLiOH\\n\\nNaOH\\n\\nKOH\\n\\nRbOH\\n\\nCsOH\\n\\nTlOH\\n\\nCa(OH)2\\n\\nSr(OH)2\\n\\nBa(OH)2\\n\\nlithium hydroxide\\n\\nsodium hydroxide\\n\\npotassium hydroxide\\n\\nrubidium hydroxide\\n\\ncesium hydroxide\\n\\nthallium(I) hydroxide\\n\\ncalcium hydroxide\\n\\nstrontium hydroxide\\n\\nbarium hydroxide\\n\\n*First proton only\\n\\nTABLe 20.2 hydrogen halide \\nmolar bond enthalpies\\n\\nHX\\nMolar bond \\n\\nenthalpy/kJ∙mol−1\\n\\nHF\\n\\nHCl\\n\\nHBr\\n\\nHI\\n\\n570\\n\\n432\\n\\n366\\n\\n298\\n\\n\\n\\n20-4. ALMoST ALL orgAnIc AcIDS Are weAk AcIDS 735\\n\\nNow let’s turn our attention to the Na+(aq) cation. Na+(aq) is the cation \\npresent in the strong base NaOH(aq). As we have already seen, like strong acids, \\nstrong bases dissociate completely in water. Therefore, a Na+(aq) cation has \\nno tendency to form NaOH(aq) by undergoing a proton transfer reaction with \\nwater, and so Na+(aq) is a neutral cation in water.\\n\\nTherefore, we can conclude that the cations of the nine strong bases and the \\nanions of five of the strong acids listed in Table 20.1 form neutral ions in aque-\\nous solutions. Sulfuric acid, H2SO4, is a strong acid for only the dissociation \\nof the first proton. The anion, HSO4–(aq), is a weak acid as we shall discuss in \\nSection 20-12. These neutral ions are listed in Table 20.3. Because NaCl(s) dis-\\nsociates into neutral cations Na+(aq) and neutral anions Cl–(aq), an NaCl(aq) \\nsolution is neutral. In contrast, because NaOH(s) dissociates into neutral cat-\\nions Na+(aq) and strongly basic anions OH–(aq), a NaOH(aq) solution is basic. \\nThis illustrates a very important point: in order to determine whether a given \\nsolution is acidic, basic, or neutral, we must look at all  the ions present in the \\nsolution. We shall return to the question of predicting whether various salts \\nform acidic, basic, or neutral solutions in Section 20-11.\\n\\nTABLe 20.3 neutral cations and anions\\n\\nNeutral cations Neutral anions\\n\\nLi+(aq)\\n\\nNa+(aq)\\n\\nK+(aq)\\n\\nRb+(aq)\\n\\nCs+(aq)\\n\\nTl+(aq)\\n\\nMg2+(aq)\\n\\nCa2+(aq)\\n\\nSr2+(aq)\\n\\nBa2+(aq)\\n\\nCl−(aq)\\n\\nBr−(aq)\\n\\nI−(aq)\\n\\nClO4−(aq)\\n\\nNO3−(aq)\\n\\n20-4.

Thus, \\nthe addition of a small amount of H3O+(aq) can dramatically alter the rates of \\nmany reactions (Section 18-6).\\n\\nAs we shall see, concentrations of H3O+(aq) often lie in the range from 1 M \\nto 1 × 10−14 M. Such a wide range of concentrations of H3O+(aq) made plotting \\nrates of reactions versus [H3O+] very difficult. Søren Sørenson (Frontispiece) \\nproposed expressing the hydronium ion scale on a logarithmic scale, now called \\nthe pH scale. The quantity called pH is defined as\\n\\n pH = –log([H3O+]/M) (20.4)\\n\\nWe divide [H3O+] by the unit M in Equation 20.4 so that [H3O+]/M is unitless; \\nyou can take logarithms only of unitless quantities. Chemists quickly adopted \\nthe pH scale because of its convenience in plotting chemical properties versus \\npH instead of [H3O+].\\n\\nWe use a common logarithm, that is, a logarithm to the base 10 in \\nEquation 20.4. (The properties of logarithms are reviewed in Appendix A.) \\nEquation 20.4 enables us to calculate the pH corresponding to various values of \\n[H3O+]. For example, the pH of a 5.0 × 10−10 M solution of H3O+(aq) is given by\\n\\n pH = –log([H3O\\n+]/M) = –log(5.0 × 10–10) = 9.30 \\n\\nRecall that the number of significant figures in a number determines the num-\\nber of significant digits following the decimal place in that number’s logarithm \\n(see sidebox in Section 17-4, page 618).\\n\\neXAMPLe 20-4: Calculate the pH of an aqueous solution at 25°C that has \\nbeen prepared by dissolving 0.26 grams of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2(s), \\nin water and diluting the solution to a final volume of 0.500 liters.\\n\\nSolution: We first calculate the number of moles of Ca(OH)2(s).

We take the logarithm of Equation 20.3 \\ndivided by M2 to obtain\\n\\nlog([H3O+][OH–]/M2) = log(1.0 × 10–14) = –14.00\\n\\nWe use the fact that\\n\\nlog([H3O+][OH–]/M2) = log([H3O+]/M) + log([OH–]/M) = –14.00\\n\\nand then multiply by −1 to obtain\\n\\n[–log([H3O+]/M)] + [–log([OH–]/M)] = 14.00\\n\\nNotice that the quantity –log([H3O+]/M) on the left side of this equation is the \\nquantity pH. If we define a new quantity called pOH as\\n\\n pOH = –log([OH–]/M) (20.5)\\n\\nthen we can say that, at 25°C,\\n\\n pH + pOH = 14.00 (20.6)\\n\\nrecall that log ab = log a + log b\\n\\n20-5. ph IS A MeASure of The AcIDITy of An AqueouS SoLuTIon\\n\\n\\n\\n20.

The percentage of dissociation \\n(% dissociation) of hydrofluoric acid in the 0.10 M HF(aq) solution is only\\n\\n× 100 = 7.9%× 100 =% dissociation =\\n0.0079 M\\n—\\n0.10 M\\n\\n[H3O+]—\\n[HF]0\\n\\nwhere the subscript 0 denotes the stoichiometric concentration. In contrast, \\nhydrochloric acid is completely dissociated:\\n\\n× 100 = 100%× 100 =\\n0.10 M\\n—\\n0.10 M\\n\\n[H3O+]—\\n[HCl]0\\n\\n% dissociation =\\n\\nBy stoichiometric concentration, we mean the concentration at which a solu-\\ntion is prepared. For example, a HF(aq) solution of a stoichiometric concen-\\ntration of 0.10 M means that the solution was prepared by adding 0.10 moles \\nof HF(g) to enough water to make exactly one liter of solution. The label on \\na bottle of such a solution would read “0.10 M hydrofluoric acid” or “0.10 M \\nHF(aq).” Because hydrofluoric acid only partially dissociates in water, however, \\nthe actual concentration of undissociated HF(aq) molecules at equilibrium is \\nless than 0.10 M.\\n\\nAt the same stoichiometric concentrations, a weak electrolyte such as \\nHF(aq) will be a poorer conductor than a strong electrolyte such as HCl(aq) \\nbecause fewer ions are available in HF(aq) to conduct a current. The ratio of \\nthe electrical conductivity of a 1.0 M HF(aq) solution to that of a 1.0 M HCl(aq) \\nsolution is about 0.08, in accord with their relative amounts of dissociation. \\nSimilarly, strong acids tend to react more vigorously than weak acids. Figure \\n20.4 illustrates the difference between the reactions of a strong acid and a weak \\nacid with magnesium.\\n\\nWe now consider a weak base in aqueous solution.

Most of them remain in the undissociated form \\nas CH3COOH(aq), so we expect the equilibrium concentration of undissoci-\\nated acetic acid not to differ significantly from the stoichiometric concentration. \\nConsider a 0.050-M acetic acid solution. We know that all the acetic acid either \\nremains as CH3COOH(aq) or dissociates to CH3COO−(aq), so\\n\\n 0.050 M = [CH3COOH] + [CH3COO−] (20.10)\\n\\nThis equation expresses the fact that all the CH3COOH units in the solution are \\nin the form of either undissociated acetic acid, CH3COOH(aq), or acetate ions, \\nCH3COO−(aq). A condition such as Equation 20.10, which accounts for all of a \\ncertain type of unit, is called a material balance condition.\\n\\nHow do we calculate the pH of a 0.050 M CH3COOH(aq) solution? The dis-\\nsociation of acetic acid is one source of H3O+(aq). Another source of H3O+(aq) \\nis the reaction represented by Equation 20.1,\\n\\n H2O(l ) + H2O(l ) ⇌ H3O+(aq) + OH−(aq) (20.11)\\n\\nfor which\\n\\n Kw = [H3O+][OH−] = 1.0 × 10−14 M2 (20.12)\\n\\nat 25°C. It would appear at first sight that we must consider both Equations 20.8 \\nand 20.11, along with their associated equilibrium-constant expressions. \\nHowever, because Ka is so much larger than Kw, we can neglect the contribution \\nthat Equation 20.11 makes to the overall concentration of H3O+(aq). We use just \\nEquation 20.8 to calculate the pH of the acetic acid solution and write\\n\\n x = [H3O+] = [CH3COO−] (20.13)\\n\\nNext, we set up a concentration table for the dissociation reaction as we did in \\nChapter 19:\\n\\nConcentration CH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ H3O+(aq) + CH3COO−(aq)\\n\\ninitial\\n\\nchange\\n\\nequilibrium\\n\\n0.050 M\\n\\n− x\\n\\n0.050 M − x\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n≈ 0 M\\n\\n+ x\\n\\nx\\n\\n0 M\\n\\n+ x\\n\\nx\\n\\nNote that we have set the initial concentration of H3O+(aq) essentially equal to \\n0 because we are neglecting the proton contribution of the reaction described \\n\\n\\n\\n745\\n\\nby Equation 20.11.

However, in \\ncases where the resulting concentration of H3O+(aq) is on the order of 10−6 M or \\nless, we must include the contribution from Equation 20.11 in our calculations. \\nIn general this occurs only when the value of Ka is close to that of Kw or in the \\ncase of extremely dilute solutions (see Problem 20-94).\\n\\nWe can see that the equilibrium concentration of undissociated ace-\\ntic acid, 0.049 M, is indeed very close to its stoichiometric concentration of \\n0.050 M.

The Method of Successive Approximations Is often used in \\nSolving Acid-Base equilibrium Problems\\n\\nThe use of the quadratic formula to solve equations like Equation 20.14 is effec-\\ntive but tedious. An alternate, and often faster, method of solution of a qua-\\ndratic equation is the method of successive approximations. Let’s reconsider \\nEquation 20.14:\\n\\n1.8 × 10–5 M =\\nx2\\n\\n—\\n0.050 M – x\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n20-8.  The MeThoD of SucceSSIVe APProXIMATIonS 749\\n\\nBecause acetic acid is a weak acid (as indicated by the small value of Ka), we \\nexpect that the percentage of dissociation of the acid is small. Furthermore, \\nbecause essentially all the H3O+(aq) arises from dissociation of the acid, we \\nexpect that [H3O+] will be small relative to the initial concentration of the acid. \\nWe can express this algebraically as\\n\\n0.050 M – x  ≈ 0.050 M\\n\\nso that Equation 20.14 becomes\\n\\n 1.8 × 10–5 M ≈\\nx2\\n\\n—\\n0.050 M\\n\\n \\n\\nSolving for x2, we find\\n\\nx2 ≈ (0.050 M)(1.8 × 10−5 M)\\n\\nand so \\n\\nx ≈ ����(0.050 M)(1.8 × 10–5 M) = 9.5 × 10–4 M\\n\\nThis first approximation is close to the value of 9.4 × 10−4 M obtained by the \\nsolution of the full quadratic equation using the quadratic formula in the previ-\\nous section.\\n\\nWe can now use this approximate value of x in the denominator of the right-\\nhand side of Equation 20.14 to obtain a second, more accurate, approximation; \\nthat is, we take\\n\\n1.8 × 10–5 M ≈ x\\n2\\n\\n—\\n0.050 M – 9.5 × 10–4 M\\n\\nThus, we calculate that\\n\\nx ≈ ����(0.049 M)(1.8 × 10–5 M) = 9.4 × 10–4 M\\n\\nwhich is the same as the exact solution to two significant figures. If we repeat \\nthe approximation procedure, using 9.4 × 10−4 M in the denominator, then we \\nfind no further change in the value of x to two significant figures.

In other words, an unchanged \\nvalue of x on successive approximations means that we have found the correct \\nsolution.\\n\\nThe method of successive approximations is usually much faster and easier \\nthan the use of the full quadratic equation.

The Pair of Species hA(aq), A–(aq) Is called a conjugate \\nAcid-Base Pair\\n\\nWhen an acid such as CH3COOH(aq) reacts with water, water acts as a base by \\naccepting a proton from the acid according to the equation\\n\\nCH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ H3O+(aq) + CH3COO−(aq)\\n                  acid base\\n\\nIf we look at the reverse reaction equation,\\n\\nH3O+(aq) + CH3COO−(aq) ⇌ CH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l )\\n acid                 base\\n\\nwe see that H3O+(aq) donates a proton to CH3COO−(aq). In other words, \\nH3O+(aq) acts as an acid by donating a proton and CH3COO−(aq) acts as a \\nbase by accepting a proton. The base CH3COO−(aq) is called the conjugate \\nbase of the acid CH3COOH(aq). Acetic acid and the acetate anion are called a \\nconjugate acid-base pair. Similarly, the hydronium ion, H3O+(aq), is the conju-\\ngate acid of the base H2O(l ).

To see more explic-\\nitly that the CH3COO–(aq) anion is a weak base, consider the equation for the \\nreverse of the acid dissociation:\\n\\n(1) H3O+(aq) + CH3COO−(aq) ⇌ CH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l )\\n\\nBecause this reaction equation is the reverse of the equation associated with the \\nequilibrium constant Ka of the acetic acid, we see that the equilibrium constant \\nof equation (1) is K1 = 1/Ka.\\n\\nThe equation for the dissociation of water is\\n\\n(2) H2O(l ) + H2O(l ) ⇌ H3O+(aq) + OH−(aq)\\n\\n(Equation 20.1), and its equilibrium constant is K2 = Kw. If we add equations (1) \\nand (2) above, we obtain\\n\\n(3) CH3COO−(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ CH3COOH(aq) + OH−(aq) (20.17)\\n\\nThe equilibrium constant for equation (3) is the product of the equilibrium \\nconstants for equations (1) and (2) above (Equation 19.30), and so we have\\n\\nKw \\n—\\nKa \\n\\nK3 = K1K2 =\\n\\nEquation 20.17 shows explicitly that the CH3COO–(aq) anion accepts a proton \\nfrom water to yield hydroxide ions. It is the same type of equation as that for the \\n\\n\\n\\n20. The ProPerTIeS of AcIDS AnD BASeS756\\n\\nreaction between ammonia and water. Because the acetate ion acts as a base in \\nsolution, we denote the equilibrium constant for Equation 20.17 by Kb instead \\nof K3:\\n\\nKw \\n—\\nKa \\n\\nKb =CH3COO–(aq) + H2O(l ) � CH3COOH(aq) + OH–(aq)  (20.18)\\n\\nThe value of Ka for CH3COOH(aq) at 25°C is 1.8 × 10−5 M, so at 25°C the value \\nof Kb for the acetate anion is\\n\\nKb = = 5.6 × 10–10 M\\n1.0 × 10–14 M2\\n—\\n1.8 × 10–5 M\\n\\nThe small value of Kb means that the CH3COO–(aq) anion is a weak base in \\nwater.\\n\\nOnce again we emphasize that you must consider all the species present in \\na solution in order to determine if the solution is acidic, basic, or neutral. Just \\nbecause CH3COO–(aq) ions are basic, their presence in a solution does not \\nguarantee that the solution containing these ions will be basic. For example, \\neven though CH3COOH(aq) dissociates to form CH3COO–(aq) anions accord-\\ning to\\n\\nCH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ H3O+(aq) + CH3COO−(aq)\\n\\nthe resulting solution is acidic because of the presence of essentially equal \\nquantities of H3O+(aq) and CH3COO–(aq) ions and the fact that H3O+(aq) \\nions are strongly acidic, while CH3COO–(aq) ions are weakly basic. In con-\\ntrast, a solution of NaCH3COO(aq) will be basic. The Na+(aq) ions are neu-\\ntral (Section 20-3), but the CH3COO–(aq) ions react with water according to \\nEquation 20.18 to form equal quantities of CH3COOH(aq) and OH–(aq) ions. \\nThe resulting solution is basic because OH–(aq) ions are strongly basic, while \\nCH3COOH(aq) is weakly acidic. Therefore, we must be careful to examine \\neach species present in a solution before concluding whether the solution is \\nacidic, basic, or neutral.\\n\\nGenerally, the conjugate base of any weak acid is itself a weak base. In the \\ncase of a weak acid comprised of a proton and an anion, the anion is the conju-\\ngate base of the weak acid. If we denote a weak acid by HA(aq) and its conjugate \\nbase, by A−(aq), then we have the equations\\n\\n \\n[H3O+][A–]\\n—\\n\\n[HA]\\nKa =HA(aq) + H2O(l ) � H3O+(aq) + A–(aq)  (20.19)\\n\\nand\\n\\n \\n[HA][OH–]\\n—\\n\\n[A–]\\nKb =A–(aq) + H2O(l ) � HA(aq) + OH–(aq)  (20.20)\\n\\nThe first equation explicitly shows HA(aq) is an acid, and the second equation \\nexplicitly shows that its conjugate base A−(aq) is a base.

A Polyprotic Acid can Donate More Than one Proton in \\nSolution\\n\\nWe have already seen that some substances can donate more than one proton \\nin solution; for example, sulfuric acid, H2SO4(aq), can donate two protons in \\nsolution. We call an acid that can donate two acidic protons a diprotic acid. \\nSimilarly, phosphoric acid, H3PO4(aq), can donate up to three acidic protons in \\nsolution and so is called a triprotic acid. Acids that donate more than one acidic \\nproton are collectively known as polyprotic acids.\\n\\nLet’s look at the dissociation of oxalic acid, a diprotic acid. Here we shall \\nwrite its chemical formula as HOOCCOOH to emphasize the two carboxylic \\nacid groups (see Practice Problem 20-3).

A quick inspection of Table 20.9 shows that the values of successive pKa’s \\nfor any given species increase by about 3 to 6 pKa units for each proton donated. \\nThat is, each sequential value of Ka is about 10−3 to 10−6 times the value of the \\n\\n\\n\\n20-12.

Such species are said to be amphoteric. Amphoteric species are of par-\\nticular importance in biology where many molecules have both an acidic and \\na basic functional group, such as the amino acids (Figure 20.6). An interesting \\nexample of an amphoteric species is sodium hydrogen carbonate (or sodium \\nbicarbonate), NaHCO3(aq), which is the sodium salt of the weak diprotic acid \\nH2CO3(aq). Many laboratories use saturated NaHCO3(aq) solutions for treat-\\ning both base and acid burns (Figure 20.7). Let’s see how the same solution can \\nbe used to neutralize both a base and an acid. When NaHCO3(s) is dissolved \\nin water, it dissociates to form Na+(aq) and HCO3–(aq) ions. The sodium ion is \\nneutral. However, if we write out the proton-transfer reactions associated with \\nthe HCO3–(aq) ion, we find that it can act as an acid according to the equation\\n\\nHCO3−(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ H3O+(aq) + CO3\\n2−(aq)\\n\\nor as a base according to the equation\\n\\nHCO3−(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ H2CO3(aq) + OH−(aq)\\n\\nThus, HCO3−(aq) is an amphoteric species. Because HCO3−(aq) can act as both \\nan acid and a base, a safety solution containing HCO3−(aq) ions can be used to \\ntreat both base and acid burns. The chemical equations for the neutralization \\nreactions are\\n\\nHCO3−(aq) + H3O+(aq) ⇌ H2CO3(aq) + H2O(l )\\n\\nand\\n\\nHCO3−(aq) + OH–(aq) ⇌ CO3\\n2−(aq) + H2O(l )\\n\\nSuMMAry\\nThere are three major systems for classifying acids and bases in order of increas-\\ning generality: (1) An Arrhenius acid is a substance that produces H+(aq) ions in \\n\\nfigure 20.7 Bottles of saturated \\nsodium hydrogen carbonate (or \\nsodium bicarbonate), NaHCO3(aq), \\nare often used as laboratory safety \\nsolutions for the treatment of acid \\nand base burns. Sodium hydrogen \\ncarbonate is commonly known as \\nbaking soda.\\n\\nfigure 20.6 Amino acids have both \\nan acidic carboxylic acid group (red) \\nand a basic amine group (blue), \\nmaking them amphoteric in solution. \\nThe letter R here represents one of \\ntwenty specific organic side groups. \\nThe simplest amino acid, glycine, for \\nexample, has R = H.

The ProPerTIeS of AcIDS AnD BASeS768\\n\\naqueous solution and an Arrhenius base is a substance that produces OH−(aq) \\nions in aqueous solution. (2) A Brønsted-Lowry acid is a species that donates \\nprotons and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a species that accepts protons. In this \\nsystem, acid-base reactions are proton-transfer reactions. (3) A Lewis acid is \\ndefined as an electron-pair acceptor and a Lewis base is defined as an electron-\\npair donor.\\n\\nWater plays a central role in acid-base reactions because it can act either as \\nan acid or as a base. Water undergoes an autoprotonation reaction to produce \\nH3O+(aq) and OH−(aq) ions. The product of the equilibrium concentrations of \\nH3O+(aq) and OH−(aq) ions is fixed by the value of the ion-product constant \\nof water, Kw = [H3O+][OH−], which equals 1.0 × 10−14 M2 at 25°C.\\n\\nFor aqueous solutions, if [H3O+] > [OH−], the solution is acidic; if \\n[H3O+] < [OH−], the solution is basic; and if [H3O+] = [OH−], the solution is \\nneutral. The value of [H3O+] is more conveniently presented on a pH scale. \\nThe pH of a solution is defined through the equation pH = –log([H3O+]/M). \\nAt 25°C, if pH < 7, the solution is acidic; if pH > 7, the solution is basic; and if \\npH = 7, the solution is neutral. The pOH of a solution is related to the pH of the \\nsolution by the expression pOH = 14.00 − pH at 25°C.\\n\\nStrong acids and strong bases are completely dissociated in solution; weak \\nacids are only partially dissociated and weak bases are only partially proton-\\nated. The strength of a weak acid is governed by the value of Ka, its acid dis-\\nsociation constant; the strength of a weak base is governed by the value of Kb, \\nits base protonation constant. The larger the value of Ka or Kb, the stronger the \\nacid or the base, respectively. The treatment of weak acids and weak bases can \\nbe unified by the introduction of the idea of a conjugate acid-base pair. The val-\\nues of Ka and Kb for a conjugate acid-base pair obey the relation Kw = KaKb. The \\nstronger an acid, the weaker its conjugate base; the stronger a base, the weaker \\nits conjugate acid. The pKa value of an acid is given by pKa = –log(Ka/M); the \\nsmaller the value of pKa, the stronger the acid. The pKb value of a base is given \\nby pKb = –log(Kb/M); the smaller the value of pKb, the stronger the base. For \\nany conjugate acid-base pair, pKa + pKb = 14.00 at 25°C.\\n\\nMany cations and anions have acidic or basic properties. Salts that consist of \\nthese cations or anions may form acidic or basic aqueous solutions. An acid that \\ncan donate more than one acidic proton in solution is called a polyprotic acid. \\nAn amphoteric species is one that can act as either an acid or a base in solution. \\n\\nTerMS you ShouLD know\\nArrhenius acids and bases 730\\nhydronium ion, H3O+(aq) 730\\nBrønsted-Lowry acids and \\n\\nbases 730\\nproton donor 730\\nproton acceptor 730\\nproton-transfer reaction 730\\nprotonation reaction 730\\nacid-base reaction 730\\nLewis acids and bases 730\\nelectron-pair acceptor 730\\n\\nelectron-pair donor 730\\nautoprotonation reaction 731\\nion-product constant of water, \\n\\nKw 731\\nneutral solution, [H3O+] = [OH−]\\n\\n732\\nacidic solution, [H3O+] > [OH−]\\n\\n732\\nbasic solution, [H3O+] < [OH−]\\n\\n732\\nstrong acid 732\\n\\nstrong base 733\\nweak acid 733\\nweak base 733\\nneutral ion 735\\ncarboxylic acid 735\\nalkyl group 735\\ncarboxyl group 735\\ncarboxylate ion 737\\npH 738\\npOH 739\\npH meter 741\\n\\n\\n\\nequATIonS you ShouLD know how To uSe 769\\n\\npercentage of dissociation, \\n% dissociation 742\\n\\nstoichiometric concentration 742\\nacid dissociation reaction 743\\nacid dissociation constant, \\n\\nKa 744\\nmaterial balance condition 744\\npKa 747\\nmethod of successive \\n\\napproximations 748\\n\\namine 751\\nbase protonation constant, \\n\\nKb 752\\npKb 752\\nconjugate base 754\\nconjugate acid-base pair 754\\nconjugate acid 754\\nneutral cation 759\\nneutral anion 759\\nbasic anion 759\\n\\nacidic anion 759\\nacidic cation 759\\ndiprotic acid 764\\ntriprotic acid 764\\npolyprotic acid 764\\namphoteric 767\\n\\nequATIonS you ShouLD know how To uSe\\n(The values of the dissociation constants for most of the acids and bases listed in this chapter are compiled in \\nAppendix E).\\n\\nKw = [H3O+][OH−] = 1.0 × 10–14 M2 (20.3) (ion-product constant for water at 25°C)\\n\\npH = –log([H3O+]/M) (20.4) (definition of pH)\\n\\npOH = –log([OH–]/M) (20.5) (definition of pOH)\\n\\npH + pOH = 14.00 (20.6) (relation between pH and pOH at 25°C)\\n\\n[H3O+] = 10–pH M (20.7) (calculation of [H3O+] from pH)\\n\\npKa = –log(Ka/M) (20.15) (definition of pKa)\\n\\npKb = –log(Kb/M) (20.16) (definition of pKb)\\n\\n[H3O+][A–]\\n—\\n\\n[HA]\\nKa =HA(aq) + H2O(l ) � H3O+(aq) + A–(aq)\\n\\n(20.19)\\n(acid dissociation constant expression for an acid  with \\nformula HA)\\n\\n[HA][OH–]\\n—\\n\\n[A–]\\nKb =A–(aq) + H2O(l ) � HA(aq) + OH–(aq)\\n\\n(20.20)\\n(base protonation constant expression for a base with \\nformula A−)\\n\\nKa Kb = Kw (20.21)\\n(relation between Ka and Kb for a conjugate acid-base \\npair)\\n\\npKa + pKb = 14.00 (20.22)\\n(relation between pKa and pKb for a conjugate acid-base \\npair at 25°C)\\n\\n\\n\\n20.

Much of his \\nearly career was devoted to the study of the role of blood in \\nthe transport of oxygen to various organs of the body. He was \\naware that blood could resist changes in acidity and basicity, \\nbut the relationship between the hydrogen ion concentration, \\nthe composition of a buffer, and its buffering capacity was not \\nunderstood. In 1908, Henderson published two papers in the \\nAmerican Journal of Physiology, and in them put forward a simple \\nformula linking the aqueous hydrogen ion concentration and \\nthe composition of a buffer. Henderson’s equation represented a \\nsignificant advance in the understanding of acid-base chemistry at \\nthe time. One year after Henderson’s papers were published, the \\nDanish biochemist, Søren Sørensen (Chapter 20 Frontispiece), \\ncreated the pH scale. The pH scale found immediate acceptance \\namong biochemists, who had investigated the ability of living \\norganisms to buffer against excessive acidity or alkalinity. In \\n1916, Karl Albert Hasselbalch (1874–1962), not pictured, from the \\nUniversity of Copenhagen, merged Henderson’s buffer formula \\nwith Sørensen’s pH scale and wrote an expression now known as \\nthe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Hasselbalch’s simple idea of \\nexpressing the Henderson equation in terms of logarithms made \\nhis and Henderson’s names household names in chemistry. It is \\nremarkable that it was physiologists and medical scientists working \\nwith biological fluids who introduced the concepts of buffers and \\npH into the field of chemistry. \\n\\n\\n\\n777\\n\\n21.

We shall dis-cuss two important topics: buffers and acid-base titrations. Buffers are solu-\\ntions that are able to resist changes in pH and so are used to maintain the pH in \\nchemical and biochemical systems. For instance, chemically formulated cosmet-\\nics, such as “pH balanced” hair care products, use buffers to maintain a pH for \\noptimal lathering. Biochemical systems, such as our blood, employ natural buf-\\nfers to control enzyme activity, which depends markedly upon pH. In addition, \\nmany natural systems, such as lakes and streams, contain natural buffers that \\nmaintain the pH of the water, which is critical to the survival of many aquatic \\nspecies. In this chapter, we explain the chemical basis of buffer action in terms \\nof Le Châtelier’s principle, and we show how to calculate the pH of buffer solu-\\ntions. We then discuss acid-base indicators that provide a measure of the acidity \\nof a solution. We end the chapter with a discussion of acid-base titration curves \\nthat allow us to determine the total acidity or total basicity of a solution.\\n\\n21-1.  The Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation Often Can Be Used to \\nCalculate the pH of a Buffer Solution\\n\\nA solution that contains both a weak acid and its conjugate base can resist a \\nchange in pH by neutralizing either an added acid or an added base. Such a \\nsolution is called a buffer.\\n\\nAs an example, consider a solution that contains a mixture of CH3COOH(aq) \\nand its conjugate base, CH3COO−(aq). One way to prepare such a solution is by \\nmixing a solution of acetic acid with a solution of sodium acetate. Notice that \\nalthough CH3COOH(aq) is an acid and CH3COO−(aq) is a base, the two can \\nnot neutralize each other because they share a common anion. That is, a pro-\\nton transfer reaction between acetic acid and the acetate ion results in no net \\nchange to the overall concentrations of the species present in solution. In terms \\nof an equation, we have\\n\\n\\n\\n21. BUffErS And THE TiTrATiOn Of ACidS And BASES778\\n\\nCH3COOH(aq) + CH3COO−(aq) ⇌ CH3COO−(aq) + CH3COOH(aq)\\n(no net reaction)\\n\\nThus, a buffer solution, such as the acetic acid–acetate solution we have \\ndescribed here, results from a mixture of an acid with its own conjugate base.\\n\\nIf an acid is added to this buffer solution, then essentially all the added \\nH3O+(aq) ions are removed from the solution by the reaction of H3O+(aq) with \\nCH3COO−(aq) according to:\\n\\n H3O+(aq) + CH3COO−(aq) ⇌ CH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l ) (21.1)\\n\\nThis equation is the reverse of the equation that represents the dissociation \\nof CH3COOH(aq) (Equation 20.8), so the value of Kc for this equation is the \\nreciprocal of Ka (Table 20.6) for CH3COOH(aq), or Kc = 1/Ka = 5.6 × 104 M–1. \\nThis large value of Kc indicates that the reaction goes essentially to completion \\nand converts almost all the added H3O+(aq) into CH3COOH(aq).\\n\\nSuppose instead that a base is added to the buffer solution. Essentially all \\nthe added OH−(aq) ions are removed from the solution by the reaction with \\nacetic acid according to\\n\\n CH3COOH(aq) + OH−(aq) ⇌ CH3COO−(aq) + H2O(l ) (21.2)\\n\\nThis equation is the reverse of the equation that represents the basic nature \\nof CH3COO−(aq), so the value of Kc for this equation is the reciprocal of Kb \\n(Table 20.6) for CH3COO−(aq), or Kc = 1/Kb = 1.8 × 109 M–1. The large value of Kc \\nindicates that essentially all the added OH−(aq) ions are removed from solution by \\nthis reaction. Thus, a solution containing both CH3COOH(aq) and CH3COO−(aq) \\ncan react completely with added acid or added base thereby suppressing changes \\nin pH when a small amount of either an acid or a base is added.\\n\\nThis buffer solution contains both CH3COOH(aq) and CH3COO−(aq), and \\nso we have to consider the two equilibrium equations:\\n\\nCH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ H3O+(aq) + CH3COO−(aq) (21.3)\\nKa = 1.8 × 10–5 M\\n\\nCH3COO−(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ OH−(aq) + CH3COOH(aq) (21.4)\\nKb = 5.6 × 10–10 M\\n\\nBecause the equilibrium constants for both of these equations are small, both \\nequilibria lie far to the left and neither [CH3COOH] nor [CH3COO−] will differ \\nsignificantly from its stoichiometric concentration. Consequently, we can write\\n\\n[CH3COOH] ≈ [CH3COOH]0\\n\\n[CH3COO−] ≈ [CH3COO−]0\\n\\nwhere the subscript zero emphasizes that these are stoichiometric concen- \\ntrations.\\n\\nNow let’s calculate the pH of a buffer solution that is, say, 0.10 M in \\nCH3COOH(aq) and 0.15 M in CH3COO−(aq). The conjugate acid-base equilib-\\nrium equation involving these two species is given by Equation 21.3.\\n\\nHere we assume sufficient buffer to \\nneutralize essentially all the added \\nacid or base.\\n\\nThroughout this chapter, we shall \\ntake all solutions to be at 25°C.\\n\\n\\n\\n779\\n\\nIf we neglect the source of H3O+(aq) from Equation 20.1,\\n\\nH2O(l ) + H2O(l ) ⇌ H3O+(aq) + OH−(aq)  Kw = 1.0 × 10–14 M\\n\\nthen we can write the concentration table associated with Equation 21.3 as \\nfollows:\\n\\nConcentration CH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ H3O+(aq) + CH3COO−(aq)\\n\\ninitial\\n\\nchange\\n\\nequilibrium\\n\\n0.10 M\\n\\n− x\\n\\n0.10 M − x\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n≈ 0 M\\n\\n+ x\\n\\nx\\n\\n0.15 M\\n\\n+ x\\n\\n0.15 M + x\\n\\nSubstituting these values into the equilibrium-constant expression gives\\n\\n= 1.8 × 10–5 M\\n x(0.15 M + x)\\n—\\n\\n0.10 M – x\\n\\nWe could solve this equation for x by using the quadratic equation, but because \\nCH3COOH(aq) is a weak acid, we expect that the value of x will be small. \\nTherefore, we neglect x with respect to both 0.10 M and 0.15 M, and write\\n\\n≈ 1.8 × 10–5 M\\n x(0.15 M)\\n—\\n\\n0.10 M\\n\\nwhich yields\\n\\n= 1.2 × 10–5 Mx ≈\\n(0.10 M)(1.8 × 10–5 M)\\n—\\n\\n0.15 M\\n\\nThis small value for x  justifies our approximation of neglecting x  with respect \\nto 0.10 M and 0.15 M. Because [H3O+] = x, the pH of the solution is given by\\n\\npH = –log([H3O+]/M) = –log(1.2 × 10–5) = 4.92\\n\\nGenerally, a buffer solution consists of a weak acid HA(aq) and its conjugate \\nbase A−(aq).

It enables us to use the stoichiometric concentrations directly without \\nthe need for a stepwise analysis of the equilibrium. The Henderson-Hasselbalch \\nequation is used extensively in biochemistry. Whenever Equation 21.7 is applied, \\nseveral general conditions must be met:\\n\\n 1.  The value of Ka for the conjugate acid-base pair should be in the range of \\nabout 10–4 M to 10–11 M.\\n\\n 2. The ratio [base]0/[acid]0 must be between roughly 0.1 and 10.\\n\\n 3.  The values of [base]0 and [acid]0 should be in the range of roughly 10–3 M \\nto 1 M.\\n\\nWhile these conditions may appear restrictive, in fact the majority of the acid-\\nbase systems of interest to us fall within these ranges.\\n\\nLet’s calculate the pH of a buffer that is 0.25 M in formic acid, HCOOH(aq), \\nand 0.15 M in potassium formate, KHCOO(aq). Because potassium formate \\nis a strong electrolyte consisting of potassium ions and formate ions, the solu-\\ntion will be 0.25 M in HCOOH(aq) and 0.15 M in HCOO−(aq). We see from \\nTable 20.6 that the value of Ka for  formic acid is 1.8 × 10−4 M and the value \\nof Kb for the  formate  anion is 5.6 × 10−11 M. The K+(aq) ion is a neutral ion \\n(Table 20.7) and so does not participate in the buffer activity. Because the value \\nof Ka is between 10–4 M and 10–11 M, the ratio of initial concentrations of base \\nto acid is 0.15 M/0.25 M = 0.6, and the molarities of the conjugate acid-base \\npair are within the range 10–3 M to 1 M, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch \\nequation to obtain the pH of the buffer solution:\\n\\npH ≈ pKa + log = 3.75 – 0.22 = 3.53\\n0.15 M\\n—\\n0.25 M\\n\\nOne must always be careful to check \\nthese conditions before applying the \\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation.\\n\\n\\n\\n781\\n\\nEXAMPLE 21-1: Calculate the pH of a buffer solution that is 0.050 M in \\nNH4Cl(aq) and 0.20 M in NH3(aq).\\n\\nSolution: Because NH4Cl(aq) is a strong electrolyte, it dissociates com-\\npletely to form NH4+(aq) ions and Cl−(aq) ions. Therefore, the solution will \\nbe 0.050 M in NH4+(aq) and 0.20 M in NH3(aq). Because the chloride ion \\nis a neutral ion, it does not participate in the buffer activity. In this case \\nNH4+(aq) is the conjugate acid and NH3(aq) is the conjugate base. We see \\nfrom Table 20.6 that the value of Ka for NH4+ is 5.6 × 10−10 M and that the \\nvalue of Kb for NH3(aq) is 1.8 × 10−5 M. Because the value of Ka is between \\n10–4 M and 10–11 M, the ratio of concentrations is 4.0, and the concentrations \\nof the conjugate acid-base pair are between 10–3 M and 1 M, we can use the \\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation to obtain the pH of this buffer solution:\\n\\npH ≈ pKa + log = 9.25 + 0.60 = 9.85\\n0.20 M\\n—\\n0.050 M\\n\\nPrACTiCE PrOBLEM 21-1: Calculate the pH of a buffer solution that is \\n0.85 M in CH3COOH(aq) and 0.30 M in NaCH3COO(aq).\\n\\nAnswer: pH = 4.29\\n\\n21-2.  A Buffer Solution Suppresses a Change in pH When a Small \\nAmount of Either an Acid or a Base is Added\\n\\nNow let’s consider the response of a buffer solution to the addition of small \\namounts of an acid or a base. Let the buffer be composed of a solution that is \\n0.100 M in CH3COOH(aq) and 0.100 M in CH3COO−(aq). Suppose that 10.0 mL \\nof 0.100 M HCl(aq) is added to 100.0 mL of the buffer solution. The number of \\nmillimoles of acid in 10.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl(aq) is\\n\\nmmol of H3O+ added = (10.0 ml)(0.100 M) = 1.00 mmol\\n\\nThe H3O+(aq) reacts with the CH3COO−(aq) in the buffer solution according to\\n\\nH3O+(aq) + CH3COO−(aq) → CH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l )\\n\\nRecall from Section 21.1 that the equilibrium constant for this equation is \\nquite large (5.6 × 104 M), so the reaction goes essentially to completion. Before \\nthe HCl(aq) is added, the number of millimoles of acetate ion in the buffer \\nsolution is\\n\\nmmol of CH3COO–\\n\\nbefore HCl added� � = (100.0 mL)(0.100 M) = 10.0 mmol\\nAccording to the chemical equation above, the number of millimoles of \\nCH3COO−(aq) after the addition of 10.0 mL of 0.10 M HCl(aq) is\\n\\nmmol of CH3COO–\\n\\nafter HCl added� � mmol of CH3COO\\n–\\n\\nbefore HCl added� � mmol of H3O+ added� �= –\\n= 10.0 mmol – 1.00 mmol = 9.0 mmol\\n\\nAs we saw in Chapter 12, using units \\nof millimoles when working with \\ndilute solutions is more convenient \\nthan using units of moles.\\n\\n21-2.

The pH \\ndecreased because we added an acid. Notice that the volumes (110.0 mL) cancel \\nout in the logarithm term. Therefore, we can work directly with the number of \\nmillimoles of the conjugate acid and base without the need to convert to molari-\\nties before taking the logarithm of the ratio.\\n\\nIn contrast to the above result, if we add 10.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl(aq) to \\n100.0 mL of pure water, then the pH of the resulting solution is\\n\\n[H3O+] = = 9.09 × 10–3 M=\\nmmol of H3O+—\\nmL of solution\\n\\n(10.0 mL)(0.100 M)\\n—\\n\\n110.0 ml\\n\\nor\\n\\npH = –log([H3O+]/M) = –log(9.09 × 10–3) = 2.04\\n\\nThe pH of pure water is 7.00, so we see that the pH changes by about 5 pH units. \\nBecause pH is a logarithmic scale, the value of [H3O+] changes by a factor of \\n105, or 100 000. In contrast, the pH of the buffer solution changes by less than \\n0.1 pH unit, which corresponds to the value of [H3O+] changing by about a fac-\\ntor of 1.2. This demonstrates the amazing power of a buffer solution to resist \\nchanges in pH.\\n\\n\\n\\n783\\n\\nEXAMPLE 21-2: Calculate the change in pH when 10.0 mL of 0.100 M \\nNaOH(aq) is added to 100.0 mL of a buffer that is 0.100 M in CH3COOH(aq) \\nand 0.100 M in CH3COO−(aq).

A BUffEr SOLUTiOn SUPPrESSES A CHAngE in pH\\n\\n\\n\\n21. BUffErS And THE TiTrATiOn Of ACidS And BASES784\\n\\nThe capacity of a buffer to resist changes in pH is not unlimited. If sufficient \\nacid (or base) is added to neutralize all the conjugate base (or all the conjugate \\nacid), then the pH of the solution will change significantly. In such a case the \\nbuffer is simply overwhelmed (Figure 21.1). The number of millimoles of acid \\nor base that may be added to a buffer before it is overwhelmed is called the \\nbuffer capacity (see Problems 21-11 and 21-12).\\n\\nAnother property of buffers is their ability to resist changes in pH when \\ndiluted with solvent. This property is readily understood from the Henderson-\\nHasselbalch equation. If we dilute a buffer solution by, say, a factor of 2, then \\nthe stoichiometric concentration of the base, [base]0, and the stoichiometric \\nconcentration of the acid, [acid]0, both decrease by a factor of 2, but the ratio \\nof the stoichiometric concentrations does not change:\\n\\n= \\n1–2[base]0—\\n1–2[acid]0\\n\\n[base]0 —\\n[acid]0 \\n\\nThus the pH of the buffer solution does not change with dilution. The effects  \\nof the addition of HCl(aq) and NaOH(aq) and of dilution on the pH of the \\nbuffer solutions CH3COOH(aq)–CH3COO−(aq) and NH4+(aq)–NH3(aq) are \\nsummarized in Table 21.1.\\n\\nThe activity of many enzymes depends on pH, and numerous biological \\nsystems have natural buffers to control enzyme activities. Essentially constant \\npH values are required for maintaining the delicate balances in the complex \\nsequences of biochemical reactions essential to the existence of life. For exam-\\nple, blood is buffered by a mixture of carbonates, phosphates, and proteins \\nand exhibits a remarkably constant pH value of 7.4. At pH values lower than \\n7.3, the blood cannot efficiently remove carbon dioxide from cells, and at pH \\nvalues greater than 7.7, blood cannot efficiently release carbon dioxide to the \\nlungs. Blood pH values outside the range 7.0 to 7.8 cannot sustain human life.\\n\\nThe following Example and Practice Problem illustrate how to prepare a \\nbuffer solution with a specified pH.\\n\\nfigure 21.1 The left cylinder con-\\ntains 100 mL of a sodium acetate  \\nand acetic acid buffer solution with \\nbromcresol green indicator that  \\nindicates that the pH of the solu-\\ntion is about 5 (see Figure 21.7). The \\nmiddle cylinder contains 100 mL of \\nthe CH3COO−(aq)–CH3COOH(aq) \\nbuffer solution plus 7.0 mL of 0.10 M \\nNaOH(aq). The fact that the solution \\nremains green indicates that the pH \\nof the solution is still about 5. The \\nright cylinder contains 100.0 mL of \\nthe CH3COO−(aq)–CH3COOH(aq) \\nbuffer solution plus 25.0 mL of 0.10 M \\nNaOH(aq). The change in the indicator \\ncolor from green to blue shows that the \\npH has increased significantly and that \\nthe buffer has been overwhelmed by the \\naddition of a large amount NaOH(aq).\\n\\nTABLE 21.1 resistance of two buffer solutions to change in pH upon addition of acid or base and upon dilution\\n\\nBuffer Initial pH\\n\\npH after addition of \\n10.0 mL of 0.100 M \\n\\nHCl(aq) to 100.0 mL \\nof buffer\\n\\npH after addition of \\n10.0 mL of 0.100 M \\n\\nNaOH(aq) to \\n100.0 mL of buffer\\n\\npH after \\ntwo-fold \\n\\ndilution with \\nwater\\n\\n0.100 M CH3COOH(aq)\\nand\\n\\n0.100 M CH3COO−(aq)\\n4.74 4.65 4.83 4.74\\n\\n0.100 M NH4+(aq)\\nand\\n\\n0.100 M NH3(aq)\\n9.25 9.16 9.34 9.25\\n\\n\\n\\n785\\n\\nEXAMPLE 21-3: To study a certain chemical reaction, the pH of the solu-\\ntion must be fixed and maintained throughout the experiment. In the \\nexperiment, the pH must be 4.40. You have available a solution of 0.100 M \\nCH3COOH(aq) and another solution of 0.100 M NaCH3COO(aq). Describe \\nhow to prepare 100.0 mL of a buffer solution with a pH of 4.40.\\n\\nSolution: We see from Table 20.6 that Ka = 1.8 × 10−5 M for CH3COOH(aq). \\nBecause Ka is within the range 10–3 M to 10–11 M and the concentrations of \\nboth solutions are 0.100 M, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. \\nSubstituting the values pH = 4.40 and pKa = 4.74 into Equation 21.7, we find\\n\\n4.40 ≈ 4.74 + log\\n[CH3COO–]0\\n—\\n[CH3COOH]0\\n\\nTaking the antilogarithm of both sides and solving for \\n[CH3COO–]0/[CH3COOH]0, we find\\n\\n= 10(4.40 – 4.74) = 10–0.34 = 0.457\\n[CH3COO–]0\\n—\\n[CH3COOH]0\\n\\nNow let x equal the number of milliliters of the 0.100 M NaCH3COO(aq) \\nsolution and y equal the number of milliliters of the 0.100 M \\nCH3COOH(aq) solution that we should use.

An indicator is Used to Signal the End Point of a Titration\\nChemists often need to determine the amount of a substance present in a solu-\\ntion. The determination of the concentration of a solution of an acid or a base \\nserves as a good example. A commonly used technique is titration, the addition \\nof a precisely measured volume of a solution of known concentration to a pre-\\ncisely measured volume of the solution of unknown concentration (Figure 21.2). \\nThe solutions are chosen so that they react completely, and the completion of \\nthe reaction is signaled by the sudden change in some physical property, such as \\nthe color of a compound that has been added in small quantity to the reaction \\nmixture (Figure 21.3).\\n\\nIn the titration of an acid by a base, a plot of the pH of the resulting solution \\nas a function of the volume of the added base is called a titration curve. The \\ntitration curve of a 50.0-mL sample of 0.100 M HCl(aq) titrated with 0.100 M \\nNaOH(aq) is shown in Figure 21.4. The net ionic equation for the titration of \\nHCl(aq) with NaOH(aq) is\\n\\n H3O+(aq) + OH−(aq) → 2 H2O(l ) (21.8)\\n\\nThe value of the equilibrium constant for the reaction represented by Equation \\n21.8 is\\n\\n= 1.0 × 1014 M–2K =\\n1\\n\\n—\\nKw \\n\\nThe large value of K  indicates that essentially all the H3O+(aq) and OH−(aq) \\nreact to form H2O(l ); the reaction goes to completion.\\n\\nAt the equivalence point, stoichiometrically equivalent amounts of acid and \\nbase have reacted, and the reaction is complete. This occurs when the number \\nof millimoles of OH−(aq) added from the NaOH(aq) is equal to the number of \\nmillimoles of H3O+(aq) present initially from the HCl(aq). Therefore, we have\\n\\nmmol of H3O+\\n\\npresent initially�� ��mmol of OH\\n–\\n\\nrequired = (50.0 ml)(0.100 M) = 5.00 mmol=\\n\\nwhich corresponds to a volume of 0.100 M NaOH(aq) solution equal to\\n\\nfigure 21.2 A diagrammatic \\nrepresentation of the setup used \\nfor titration.

Because NaCl(aq) is a neutral salt, the pH is 7.0 at the equivalence \\npoint (Figure 21.4). When we titrate an acid of unknown concentration with a \\nbase of known concentration, or a base of unknown concentration with an acid \\nof known concentration, we need some way to tell when the equivalence point \\nhas been reached. Let’s consider the case of titrating HCl(aq) with KOH(aq). \\nBecause KCl(aq) is a neutral salt, the pH at the equivalence point is 7.0. Before \\nthe equivalence point is reached, not all the HCl(aq) has been neutralized, so the \\nsolution is acidic (pH < 7). Beyond the equivalence point, where all the HCl(aq) \\nhas been neutralized and excess KOH(aq) has been added, the solution is basic \\n(pH > 7). If there were a substance that was one color (e.g., yellow) at pH < 7 \\nand another color (e.g., blue) at pH > 7, then we could add a few drops of this \\nsubstance to the HCl(aq) being titrated and it would signal the occurrence of the \\nequivalence point as the point when the solution just changes from yellow to blue. \\nWe call such a substance an indicator, because it indicates the pH of the solution \\nby its color.\\n\\nfigure 21.3 Titration of HCl(aq) with NaOH(aq).

BUffErS And THE TiTrATiOn Of ACidS And BASES788\\n\\nIn fact, many substances change color with pH (Figure 21.5). In Chapter 10 \\nwe discussed the use of litmus as an acid-base indicator. Litmus is a naturally \\noccurring substance that is red in acidic solutions and blue in basic solutions. \\nAnother acid-base indicator is a compound called bromthymol blue, which is \\nyellow in acidic solutions and blue in basic solutions (Figure 21.6). Its color \\nchanges with pH because it is a weak organic acid, and the color of the proton-\\nated form, HIn(aq) (In stands for indicator), is different from the unproton-\\nated form, In−(aq). The acid form of bromthymol blue, HIn(aq), is yellow, and \\nits conjugate base, In−(aq), is blue. We can represent the acid-base reaction of \\nbromthymol blue by the equation\\n\\nHIn(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ In−(aq) + H3O+(aq) (21.9)\\nyellow blue\\n\\nAccording to Le Châtelier’s principle, the reaction equilibrium lies to the \\nleft if [H3O+] is large (low pH) and to the right if [H3O+] is small (high pH). \\nConsequently, a solution containing bromthymol blue is yellow at low pH and \\nblue at high pH. In the transition region (about pH = 7 for bromthymol blue), \\nthe solution is green, which is a mixture of yellow and blue.\\n\\nWe can make this discussion quantitative by considering the acid-dissociation \\nconstant of bromthymol blue. The acid-dissociation constant, Kai, for a general \\nindicator (Equation 21.9) is\\n\\n [H3O\\n+][In–]\\n\\n—\\n[HIn]\\n\\nKai =  (21.10)\\n\\nAs we have noted, a solution containing bromthymol blue is green in the transi-\\ntion region because both the HIn(aq) and In−(aq) forms are present simultane-\\nously in comparable concentrations; that is,\\n\\n[HIn] ≈ [In−]\\n\\nSubstitution of the condition [HIn] ≈ [In−] into Equation 21.10 yields\\n\\n[H3O+] ≈ Kai\\n\\nBy taking the negative of the logarithms of the terms in this expression and \\nusing the definitions of pH and pKa, we obtain\\n\\n pH ≈ pKai (21.11)\\n\\nIn other words, if bromthymol blue is green in a solution, then the pH of the \\nsolution is approximately equal to the pKai value for bromthymol blue. The \\nvalue of pKai for bromthymol blue is 7.3, so the pH of the green solution is about \\n7. Generally, the pH range over which an indicator changes color is approxi-\\nmately equal to pKai ± 1. Even though the color change might occur across two \\npH units, it occurs suddenly during a titration because most titration curves \\nare very steep around the equivalence point (Figure 21.4). Table 21.2 lists the \\nvalues of the pKai’s and the color changes of a number of indicators.\\n\\nBecause of the intense color of indicators, only a very small concentration is \\nnecessary to produce a visible color. Thus, its contribution to the total acidity of \\n\\nfigure 21.6 Bromthymol blue is an \\nacid-base indicator that is yellow if \\nthe pH is less than 7 and blue if the \\npH is greater than 7.

The point at which the indicator changes color is called the end \\npoint of the titration. It is important to distinguish between equivalence point \\nand end point. The equivalence point is the point at which stoichiometrically \\nequivalent amounts of acid and base have been brought together. The acid-base \\nreaction is complete at the equivalence point. The end point is the point at which \\nthe indicator changes color. The end point is the experimental estimate of the \\nequivalence point. An indicator should be chosen so that the end point signaled \\nby the indicator corresponds as closely as possible with the equivalence point.\\n\\nfigure 21.8 Aqueous solutions of the \\nacid-base indicator thymol blue at pH \\nvalues of 1 through 14 (left to right). \\nObserve that the indicator undergoes \\ntwo color changes.\\n\\n\\n\\n791\\n\\nEXAMPLE 21-5: By referring to Figures 21.4 and 21.7, choose an indicator \\nto signal the equivalence point shown in Figure 21.4.\\n\\nSolution: From Figure 21.4, we note that the equivalence point occurs at \\npH = 7.0. The titration curve is very steep in the vicinity of the equivalence \\npoint, however, so an indicator with a color transition range lying between \\npH = 5 and pH = 9 would be suitable in this case. Referring to Figure 21.7, we \\nsee that there are several possible choices, for example, bromthymol blue or \\nphenolphthalein.

The pH Changes Abruptly at the Equivalence Point of the \\nTitration of a Strong Acid with a Strong Base\\n\\nTitration curves are obtained experimentally by measuring the pH as a func-\\ntion of the volume of added acid or base. In order to understand the origin of \\nexperimental titration curves and to interpret them, in this section we shall \\ncalculate some of the points on the titration curve of a strong acid with a strong \\nbase (Figure 21.4). In particular, we shall titrate 50.0 mL of 0.100 M HCl(aq) \\nwith 0.100 M NaOH(aq).\\n\\nThe concentration of H3O+(aq) in the 0.100 M HCl(aq) solution before any \\nbase is added is [H3O+] = 0.100 M, so the pH of the solution initially is 1.00. \\nAfter 10.0 mL of the 0.100 M NaOH(aq) is added, the total volume of the result-\\ning solution is 50.0 mL + 10.0 mL = 60.0 mL. The OH−(aq) from the NaOH(aq) \\nreacts with the H3O+(aq) from the HCl(aq) to produce water according to:\\n\\nH3O+(aq) + OH−(aq) → 2 H2O(l )\\n\\nThus, when 10.0 mL of 0.100 M NaOH(aq) is added to 50.0 mL of 0.100 M \\nHCl(aq), the number of millimoles of H3O+(aq) that reacts is equal to the num-\\nber of millimoles of OH−(aq) added:\\n\\nmmol of OH–\\n\\nadded = (10.0 ml)(0.100 M)\\nmmol of H3O+\\n\\nreacted= 1.00 mmol =� � � �\\nThe total number of millimoles of H3O+(aq) initially present in 50.0 mL of \\n0.100 M HCl(aq) is\\n\\nmmol of H3O+\\n\\ninitially present = (50.0 ml)(0.100 M) = 5.00 mmol� �\\nThe concentration of H3O+(aq) that remains after the addition of 10.0 mL \\n\\nof 0.100 M NaOH(aq) is equal to the number of millimoles of H3O+(aq) that \\n\\n21-4.

To do so, we must \\n\\nconsider the principal species in the solution at the equivalence point, where \\nthe number of moles of NaOH(aq) added is equal to the number of moles of \\nCH3COOH(aq) initially present. The equation for the reaction is\\n\\nCH3COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCH3COO(aq) + H2O(l )       (21.15)\\n\\nIt is important to realize that the reaction described by Equation 21.15 goes \\nessentially to completion even though CH3COOH(aq) is a weak acid. We can see \\nthis quantitatively by calculating the equilibrium constant of Equation 21.15. \\nThe net ionic equation for the titration of CH3COOH(aq) with NaOH(aq) is\\n\\n CH3COOH(aq) + OH−(aq) ⇌ CH3COO−(aq) + H2O(l ) (21.16)\\n\\nEquation 21.16 is simply the reverse of the base protonation reaction equation \\nfor CH3COO−(aq), so Kc = 1/Kb = 1.8 × 109 M–1 (see Equation 21.4). This large \\nvalue of Kc indicates that the equilibrium described by Equation 21.16 lies far \\nto the right and that CH3COOH(aq) reacts essentially completely when a strong \\nbase is added to the solution.\\n\\nBecause the reaction described by Equation 21.16 goes essentially to com-\\npletion, the solution at the equivalence point of the titration is essentially just a \\nNaCH3COO(aq) solution. To calculate the concentration of this NaCH3COO(aq) \\nsolution, we use the fact that we started with 50.0 mL of 0.100 M CH3COOH(aq) \\n\\n\\n\\n21.

Thus, we see \\nthat the pH at the equivalence point in Figure 21.9 is 8.72.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 21-7: Compare the use of bromthymol blue and phenolphtha-\\nlein as indicators for the titration of 50.0 mL of 0.100 M CH3COOH(aq) \\nwith 0.100 M NaOH(aq).

We can \\nuse the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pH at the midpoint \\n\\n\\n\\n797\\n\\nand at points around the midpoint of the titration. The midpoint is the point \\nat which one-half of the acid has reacted with the strong base. Let’s now cal-\\nculate the pH at the midpoint, which for the titration of 50.0 mL of 0.100 M \\nCH3COOH(aq) with 0.100 M NaOH(aq) occurs at the point indicated on the \\ntitration curve in Figure 21.9. We can calculate the stoichiometric concentra-\\ntions of CH3COOH(aq) and CH3COO−(aq) at the midpoint. The total number \\nof millimoles of CH3COOH(aq) present initially is\\n\\nmmol of CH3COOH\\ninitially present � � = (50.0 mL)(0.100 M) = 5.00 mmol\\n\\nThe number of millimoles of NaOH(aq) added is one half of 5.00 mmol, or \\n2.50 mmol, which corresponds to a volume of 0.100 M NaOH(aq) solution \\nequal to\\n\\n= 25.0 mL=V =\\n2.50 mmol\\n—\\n\\n0.100 M\\n\\nn\\n—\\nM \\n\\nBecause the neutralization reaction (Equation 21.16) goes essentially to com-\\npletion, all the OH−(aq) reacts with CH3COOH(aq). Furthermore, the number \\nof millimoles of CH3COO−(aq) produced is equal to the number of millimoles \\nof OH−(aq) added, so at the midpoint we have 2.50 millimoles of CH3COO−(aq).\\nThe number of millimoles of CH3COOH(aq) unreacted is\\n\\nmmol of CH3COOH\\nunreacted\\n\\nmmol of CH3COO–\\n\\nproduced\\nmmol of CH3COOH\\n\\ninitially present\\n\\n= 5.00 mmol – 2.50 mmol = 2.50 mmol\\n\\n= – �� ����\\n\\nThus, we find that the corresponding stoichiometric concentrations of both \\nCH3COOH(aq) and CH3COO−(aq) are\\n\\n = 0.0333 M[CH3COOH]0 = [CH3COO–]0 = \\n2.50 mmol\\n—\\n\\n75.0 mL\\n (21.18)\\n\\nat the midpoint.\\nThe actual concentrations of CH3COOH(aq) and CH3COO−(aq) will dif-\\n\\nfer slightly from their stoichiometric concentrations because of the reactions \\ndescribed by Equations 21.12 and 21.17. Because the concentrations of both \\nCH3COOH(aq) and CH3COO−(aq) are large compared with those of the other \\nspecies in solution, they are called the principal species. Notice that for the \\nprincipal species at the midpoint of a titration, we have [base]0 = [acid]0, and \\nso the solution is a buffer solution. Thus, we can also use a titration to prepare \\na buffer solution. Because Ka for CH3COOH(aq) is between 10–3 M and 10–11 M \\nand because the concentrations of [base]0 and [acid]0 are both 0.0333 M, we \\ncan apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to determine the pH. At the \\nmidpoint of a titration, therefore, we see that\\n\\npH ≈ pKa + log = pKa + log = pKa\\n[base]0 —\\n[acid]0 \\n\\n0.0333 M\\n—\\n0.0333 M\\n\\nand so pH = pKa = 4.74.\\nNote that pH at the midpoint of the titration of a weak acid by a strong base \\n\\nis equal to the value pKa of the acid.

In such cases (which are very \\ncommon), we can write\\n\\n pH = pKa  (midpoint) (21.19)\\n\\nWe can also apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to points around the mid-\\npoint of a titration curve where, as previously discussed, the ratio [base]0/[acid]0\\nis between roughly 0.1 and 10, Ka is between 10–3 M and 10–11 M, and the concen-\\ntrations of the conjugate acid-base pair are between about 10–3 M and 1 M. The \\npoints along a titration curve described by this condition are collectively called the \\nbuffer region. In Figure 21.9, the buffer region lies between 10 mL and 40 mL of \\nNaOH(aq) added. Example 21-8 illustrates the use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch \\nequation to determine the pH within the buffer region of the CH3COOH(aq)–\\nNaOH(aq) titration curve.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 21-8: Calculate the pH of the solution that results when 20.0 mL \\nof 0.100 M NaOH(aq) is added to 50.0 mL of 0.100 M CH3COOH(aq).\\n\\nSolution: The number of millimoles of NaOH(aq) added is\\n\\nmmol of NaOH\\nadded� � = (20.0 mL)(0.100 M) = 2.00 mmol\\n\\nThe NaOH(aq) reacts with CH3COOH(aq) initially present according to \\nthe net ionic equation,\\n\\nOH−(aq) + CH3COOH(aq) → H2O(l ) + CH3COO−(aq)\\n\\nThe number of millimoles of CH3COOH(aq) in the solution before the \\naddition of NaOH(aq) is\\n\\nmmol of CH3COOH\\nbefore NaOH added� � = (50.0 mL)(0.100 M) = 5.00 mmol\\n\\nAccording to the chemical equation, the number of millimoles of \\nCH3COOH(aq) after the addition of 20.0 mL of 0.100 M NaOH(aq) is\\n\\nmmol of CH3COOH\\nafter NaOH added� � mmol of CH3COOHbefore NaOH added� � mmol of NaOHadded� �= –\\n\\n= 5.00 mmol – 2.00 mmol = 3.00 mmol\\n\\nAdditionally, from the net ionic equation we see that all the NaOH(aq) \\nadded goes to produce CH3COO−(aq), so that\\n\\nmmol of NaOH\\nadded\\n\\nmmol of CH3COO–\\n\\nproduced = 2.00 mmol= �� ��\\n\\n\\n\\n799\\n\\nBecause Ka is between 10–3 M and 10–11 M, the ratio [base]0/[acid]0 is \\n2.00/3.00, and the molarity of the acid-base pair is between 10–3 M and 1 M, \\nwe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Now calculate the pH on the other side of \\nthe midpoint when 30.0 mL of 0.100 M NaOH(aq) is added to 50.0 mL of \\nCH3COOH(aq).\\n\\nAnswer: pH = 4.92\\n\\nFrom Figure 21.9 we see that the buffer region extends from a little beyond \\nthe initial point to a little before the equivalence point of the titration curve. In \\nmost cases, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to determine the \\npH of a solution being titrated at points within the buffer region. We emphasize \\nhere that the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation does not apply to points outside \\nthe buffer region, specifically, at points close to and including the initial point \\nand the equivalence point of a titration where the ratio of [base]0/[acid]0 is \\noutside the range of 0.1 to 10.\\n\\nThe calculation of the entire titration curve of a weak acid with a strong \\nbase is fairly lengthy and for the most part is left to the problems. The calcula-\\ntions of the pH at the initial point, the midpoint (pH = pKa), and the equiva-\\nlence point are almost sufficient to sketch the titration curve in Figure 21.9. All \\nwe really need is the pH at a point a little beyond the equivalence point.

Thus, \\n[OH−] = 0.00909 M + 2.8 × 10–9 M = 0.00909 M.\\n\\nWe can obtain this result more easily by the following argument. Because \\nKb is very small, the equilibrium described by Equation 21.17 lies far to \\n\\n\\n\\n801\\n\\nthe left.

Weak Bases Can Be Titrated with Strong Acids\\nWe have considered the titration of a strong acid with a strong base and a weak \\nacid with a strong base. Let’s now discuss the titration of a weak base with a \\nstrong acid. The titration curve for 50.0 mL of 0.100 M NH3(aq) with 0.100 M \\nHCl(aq) is shown in Figure 21.11. The net ionic equation for the reaction is\\n\\n NH3(aq) + H3O+(aq) → NH4+(aq) + H2O(l ) (21.21)\\n\\nCl−(aq) is a spectator ion and so does not appear in the net ionic equation.

After the equivalence point, the pH levels off at values \\naround 2 or less. A suitable indicator for the titration is methyl red, which has a \\ncolor transition range centered around pH 5 (Figure 21.12).\\n\\nAs in the case of the titration of a weak acid with a strong base, we can sketch \\nthe main features of the titration curve by calculating the initial pH, the pH at \\nthe midpoint (pH = pKa), the pH at the equivalence point, and a point after the \\nequivalence point. The following Example and Practice Problem illustrate the \\ncalculations involved in the titration of a weak base with a strong acid.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 21-11: Calculate the pH for each of the following cases in the \\ntitration of 50.0 mL of 0.100 M NH3(aq) solution with 0.100 M HCl(aq):\\n\\n(a) before addition of any HCl(aq) (the initial point)\\n(b) after addition of 20.0 mL of HCl(aq) (5.0 mL before the midpoint)\\n(c) after addition of 25.0 mL of HCl(aq) (the midpoint)\\n(d) after addition of 30.0 mL of HCl(aq) (5.0 mL after the midpoint)\\n(e) after addition of 50.0 mL of HCl(aq) (the equivalence point)\\n(f) after addition of 55.0 mL of HCl(aq)  (5.0 mL after the equivalence \\n\\npoint)\\n\\nSolution:\\n(a) Before the addition of any HCl(aq) we have a solution containing \\n50.0 mL of 0.100 M NH3(aq) which reacts with water according to,\\n\\n NH3(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH–(aq) (21.22)\\n\\nWe begin by making a concentration table,\\n\\nConcentration NH3(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ NH4+(aq) + OH−(aq)\\n\\ninitial\\n\\nchange\\n\\nequilibrium\\n\\n0.100 M\\n\\n− x\\n\\n0.100 M − x\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n0 M\\n\\n+ x\\n\\nx\\n\\n≈ 0 M\\n\\n+ x\\n\\nx\\n\\nThe equilibrium-constant expression for Equation 21.22 (Table 20.6) is\\n\\n= 1.8 × 10–5 MKb =\\nx2\\n\\n—\\n0.100 M – x \\n\\nThe method of successive approximations gives x  = [OH–] = 1.3 × 10−3 M, so \\nthe pOH is 2.88 and the pH = 11.12, in agreement with Figure 21.11.\\n\\nfigure 21.12 Aqueous solutions \\ncontaining the acid-base indicator \\nmethyl red at pH values of 2 (red), \\n5 (orange), and 10 (yellow).\\n\\n\\n\\n21.

The original solution contained (50.0 mL)(0.100 M) = 5.00 mmol \\nNH3(aq). Because Kc for the reaction described in Equation 21.21 is \\nlarge (see Example 21-10), essentially all the HCl(aq) added goes to form \\nNH4+(aq) according to NH3(aq) + HCl(aq) → NH4+(aq) + Cl–(aq). Thus, \\nafter the addition of the HCl(aq), we have 2.00 mmol of NH4+(aq) and \\n(5.00 mmol – 2.00 mmol) = 3.00 mmol NH3(aq) as the principal species in \\nsolution. The resulting solution is a buffer. Because Ka is between 10–4 M \\nand 10–11 M, the ratio [base]0/[acid]0 = 3.00/2.00, and both [base]0 and \\n[acid]0 are within the range 10–3 M to 1 M, we can apply the Henderson-\\nHasselbalch equation.

Notice that \\nregardless of whether we are titrating a weak acid or a weak base, we use \\npKa, not  pKb, in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\\n\\n(c) At this point we have added (25.0 mL)(0.100 M) = 2.50 mmol HCl(aq). \\nBecause the original amount of NH3(aq) was 5.00 mmol [see part (b) \\nabove], we are at the midpoint of the titration and [NH3]0 = [NH4+]0. \\nBecause both Ka and Kb are small, we have\\n\\npH ≈ pKa = 9.25\\n\\nin agreement with the midpoint plotted in Figure 21.11.\\n\\n(d) At this point we have added (30.0 mL)(0.100 M) = 3.00 mmol of \\nHCl(aq), and so we are slightly past the midpoint along the titration curve. \\nBecause the original amount of NH3(aq) was 5.00 mmol [see part (b) \\nabove], we have 5.00 mmol – 3.00 mmol = 2.00 mmol of NH3(aq) and 3.00 \\nmmol of NH4+(aq).

Since \\nthis is equal to the number of millimoles of NH3(aq) originally present, \\nwe are at the equivalence point of the titration and all the NH3(aq) is \\nconverted to NH4+(aq) according to Equation 21.21. Thus, we now have a \\nproblem involving the solution of the weak acid NH4+(aq), which dissociates \\naccording to the equation\\n\\nNH4+(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ NH3(aq) + H3O+(aq)\\n\\nBecause the total volume of solution is (50.0 mL + 50.0 mL) = 100.0 mL, we \\nhave that\\n\\n\\n\\n21-7.

In each section the \\nbehavior of pH versus volume of base \\nis analogous to a titration curve for a \\nmonoprotic acid.\\n\\nMany of the acids found in nature, particularly those of biological signifi-\\ncance, are polyprotic species. Let’s examine the titration of phosphoric acid, \\nH3PO4(aq), a triprotic acid, with a strong base. The titration curve for 50.0 mL \\nof 0.100 M H3PO4(aq) titrated with 0.100 M NaOH(aq) is shown in Figure 21.13. \\nThe titration curve has three equivalence points because H3PO4(aq) has three \\nacidic protons. The calculation of a titration curve like that shown in Figure \\n21.13 is fairly long, and we shall not consider it here. It is important to under-\\nstand the general shape of the curve and to see that for a polyprotic acid there \\ngenerally is a distinct section and equivalence point for each acidic proton \\nreleased.\\n\\nSo far we have considered three types of acid-base titrations. The common \\nfeature of the three types of titrations is that they all involve an acid-base reac-\\ntion with a large equilibrium constant. For an acid-base titration to be useful in \\nchemical analysis, the equation for the titration reaction must have a large value \\nof Kc. For this reason, weak acid-weak base titrations are not usually employed.\\n\\nSUMMAry\\nA buffer is a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base. A buffer suppresses \\nthe change in pH that would otherwise result from the addition of an acid or a \\nbase to a solution. The pH of a buffer solution can often be calculated by using \\nthe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

This point is chosen to be as close as possible to the equivalence point, \\nthe point on the titration curve at which stoichiometrically equivalent amounts \\nof acid and base have reacted. The pH of a titration curve usually undergoes \\nan especially rapid change in the vicinity of the equivalence point. Most of a \\ntitration curve of a weak acid or a weak base between the starting point and the \\nequivalence point is within the buffer region. In many cases we can apply the \\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation to determine the pH of the solution within this \\nregion.

During this time, de Hevesy got the idea of using radioisotopes as \\n“tracers” in reactions, where they would be chemically indistinguishable \\nfrom nonradioactive species of the same element, but could be readily \\nmeasured by their radioactivity. He measured the solubility of highly \\ninsoluble lead compounds by monitoring the radioactivity of their \\nsolutions. This work ended in 1915 when he was drafted into the Austro-\\nHungarian army. After the war, he applied his tracer technique to biology \\nand undertook the first clinical studies using radioactive isotopes. This \\nwork, however, was limited to the study of the absorption and elimination \\nof compounds involving the heavy metals lead, bismuth, and thallium \\n(elements with naturally occurring radioisotopes). The discovery of \\nmethods for producing synthetic radioisotopes in the 1930s allowed  \\nde Hevesy’s tracer technique to be applied to other, less toxic elements, \\nopening the door for the use of tracer elements in medical studies. \\nDuring World War II, de Hevesy helped hide the valuable gold in \\nthe Nobel Prize medals of several Nobel laureates from the Nazis by \\ndissolving them in aqua regia and storing the solutions on the shelf. \\nThere, despite occupation of the laboratory and a thorough search, they \\nsafely waited out the war. Later, the Nobel Society recast the medals from \\ntheir original gold. In 1943, de Hevesy was awarded the Nobel Prize in \\nChemistry, “for his work on the use of isotopes as tracers in the study of \\nchemical processes.” His method of using radioactive tracers is still widely \\nused today in chemistry, biology, and medicine.\\n\\n\\n\\n815\\n\\n22.

Analysis of this kind is called \\nqualitative analysis, and many general chemistry laboratory courses include \\nexperiments dealing with the techniques of qualitative analysis. Many of the \\nprocedures of qualitative analysis involve the formation and the separation of \\nprecipitates. We learned in Chapter 10 that many substances are insoluble or \\nhave a low solubility in water. In this chapter we treat solubility within the frame-\\nwork of chemical equilibria; this approach enables us to calculate the solubil-\\nity of a solid not only in pure water, but also in solutions of acids, bases, and \\nsalts. The types of calculations that we discuss in this chapter have many practi-\\ncal applications. For example, many metals are obtained from their ores by a \\nseries of reactions involving precipitates; the geological formation of minerals \\nand rocks is governed by the relative solubilities of various substances; and the \\nultrapurification of materials used in computers and electronic devices often \\ninvolves precipitation reactions.\\n\\n22-1.  The Solubility of an Ionic Solid Can Be Determined Using the \\nEquilibrium-Constant Expression\\n\\nIn Chapter 10, we presented a few rules that enable us to determine which ionic \\nsolids (salts) are soluble in water and which are not. We defined the solubility \\nof a substance as the quantity of that substance that is dissolved in a saturated \\nsolution. We chose to call any substance whose solubility is less than 0.01 M \\ninsoluble. In this section we shall discuss solubility more quantitatively. In par-\\nticular, we shall cast solubility in terms of chemical equilibria, using the idea of \\nan equilibrium constant.\\n\\nConsider the equilibrium between solid silver bromate and its constituent \\nions in water as described by the chemical equation\\n\\n AgBrO3(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + BrO3−(aq) (22.1)\\n\\n\\n\\n22. SolUBIlITy anD PRECIPITaTIon REaCTIonS816\\n\\nWe can write the equilibrium-constant expression for Equation 22.1 as\\n\\nKsp = [Ag+][BrO3–]\\n\\nThe subscript sp stands for solubility product, and Ksp is called the solubility-\\nproduct constant. Note that AgBrO3(s) does not appear in the Ksp expression. \\nAs we discussed in Chapter 19, a pure solid does not appear in an equilibrium-\\nconstant expression because its concentration does not vary.\\n\\nThe experimental value of Ksp at 25°C for Equation 22.1 is\\n\\n Ksp = [Ag+][BrO3–] = 5.4 × 10–5 M2 (22.2)\\n\\nEquation 22.2 states that if AgBrO3(s) is in equilibrium with an aqueous solu-\\ntion of AgBrO3(aq) at 25°C, then the product of the concentrations of Ag+(aq) \\nand BrO3–(aq) at equilibrium must equal 5.4 × 10−5 M2.\\n\\nA Ksp expression can be used to calculate the solubility of a solid. For exam-\\nple, suppose that excess AgBrO3(s) is in contact with water at 25°C. Then at \\nequilibrium\\n\\n5.4 × 10–5 M2 = [Ag+][BrO3–]\\n\\nFrom the reaction stoichiometry of Equation 22.1, we have that [Ag+] = [BrO3–] \\nbecause each formula unit of AgBrO3 that dissolves produces one Ag+(aq) ion \\nand one BrO3–(aq) ion, and because AgBrO3(s) is the only source of Ag+(aq) \\nand BrO3–(aq) ions. If we denote the solubility of AgBrO3(s) in units of molarity \\nby s, then\\n\\ns = solubility of AgBrO3(s) in water = [Ag+] = [BrO3–]\\n\\nbecause the concentration of either Ag+(aq) or BrO3–(aq) is equal to the number \\nof moles of dissolved salt per liter of solution. Thus, from the Ksp expression, we \\nhave\\n\\nKsp = 5.4 × 10–5 M2 = [Ag+][BrO3–] = s2\\n\\nand so\\n\\ns = (5.4 × 10–5 M2)1⁄ 2 = 7.3 × 10–3 M\\n\\nThe formula mass of AgBrO3(s) is 235.8, so the number of grams of AgBrO3(s) \\nthat dissolves in one liter of solution at 25°C is\\n\\n235.8 g AgBrO3—\\n1 mol AgBrO3\\n\\nsolubility in grams per liter = (7.3 × 10–3 mol·L–1) = 1.7 g·L–1� �\\n\\nEXaMPlE 22-1: The value of Ksp for BaCrO4(s) in equilibrium with an \\naqueous solution of its constituent ions at 25°C is 1.2 × 10−10 M2.

Now consider the problem of calculating the solubility in water of \\ncopper(II) iodate, Cu(IO3)2(s), which yields two  IO3−(aq) ions and one Cu2+(aq) \\nion for each Cu(IO3)2(s) formula unit that dissolves.\\n\\nThe solubility equilibrium of Cu(IO3)2(s) in water can be described by the \\nequation\\n\\nCu(IO3)2(s) ⇌ Cu2+(aq) + 2 IO3−(aq)\\n\\nThe Ksp expression for this equation is\\n\\nKsp = [Cu2+][IO3−]2\\n\\nThe experimental value of Ksp at 25°C is 7.4 × 10−8 M3, so we have at 25°C\\n\\n Ksp = [Cu2+][IO3−]2 = 7.4 × 10–8 M3  (22.3)\\n\\n\\n\\n22. SolUBIlITy anD PRECIPITaTIon REaCTIonS818\\n\\nNote that it is the square of the concentration of IO3−(aq) that appears in the \\nKsp expression for Cu(IO3)2(s) because each formula unit of Cu(IO3)2(s) that dis-\\nsolves produces two iodate ions. Thus, when Cu(IO3)2(s) is in equilibrium with \\nits constituent ions in water, the concentration of iodate ions is twice as great as \\nthe concentration of copper(II) ions if there is no other source of Cu2+(aq) and \\nIO3−(aq) ions, and so we have [IO3−] = 2[Cu2+]. The solubility of Cu(IO3)2(s) in \\npure water is equal to [Cu2+] because each mole of Cu(IO3)2(s) that dissolves \\nyields one mole of Cu2+(aq). If we denote the solubility of Cu(IO3)2(s) in pure \\nwater by s, then [Cu2+] = s and [IO3−] = 2s. Combining these results with the Ksp \\nexpression, Equation 22.3, yields\\n\\n7.4 × 10−8 M3 = [Cu2+][IO3−]2 = (s)(2s)2 = 4s3\\n\\nand\\n\\n7.4 × 10–8 M3\\n—\\n\\n4\\ns = = 2.6 × 10–3 M\\n\\n1⁄ 3\\n\\n� �\\nTherefore [Cu2+] = s = 2.6 × 10−3 M and [IO3−] = 2s = 5.3 × 10−3 M.

Prior to the 1900s such work was painstakingly difficult, requir-\\ning the careful evaporation of large volumes of water from saturated solutions \\nfollowed by precise weighing of the remaining residue. In the early 1900s, how-\\never, George de Hevesy (Frontispiece) pioneered the technique of using radio-\\nisotopes as “tracers” to measure the solubility of sparingly soluble salts, such as \\nthose of lead and other heavy metals for which stable radioisotopes were then \\navailable. First he would saturate a solution with a salt formed from a radioiso-\\ntope, such as *PbSO4(s), where we denote the lead atoms with an asterisk to \\n\\n\\n\\n22-2.

He then separated out any undissolved \\nsolid and finally measured the radioactivity of the resulting solution. From this, \\nhe was able to accurately calculate the concentration of *Pb2+(aq) ions dissolved \\nin the solution, and thus determine the solubility of the salt and its correspond-\\ning value of Ksp. The use of radioactive tracers in chemistry and medicine is \\nfurther discussed in Interchapter O.\\n\\n22-2.  The Solubility of an Ionic Solid Decreases When a Common \\nIon Is Present in the Solution\\n\\nIn Section 22-1 we discussed the solubility of an ionic solid in pure water. In this \\nsection we discuss the solubility of ionic solids in solutions that already contain \\none of the ionic constituents of the salt.\\n\\nConsider the problem of calculating the solubility of silver bromate, \\nAgBrO3(s), in an aqueous solution at 25°C that is 0.10 M in sodium bromate, \\nNaBrO3(aq), which is a strong electrolyte. As we learned in the previous section, \\nthe solubility equilibrium of AgBrO3(s) can be described by\\n\\nAgBrO3(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + BrO3−(aq)\\n\\nand the corresponding solubility-product constant expression is\\n\\n Ksp = [Ag+][BrO3−] = 5.4 × 10−5 M2 (22.4)\\n\\nIt is important to realize that the ionic concentrations in Equation 22.4 are the \\ntotal  ionic concentrations, regardless of the source of each ionic species. In the case of \\nAgBrO3(s) dissolved in a 0.10 M NaBrO3(aq) solution, the Ag+(aq) ions come \\nonly from the AgBrO3(s) that dissolves. The BrO3−(aq) ions, on the other hand, \\ncome from two sources: from the 0.10 M NaBrO3(aq) initially present, which \\nis completely dissociated into Na+(aq) ions and BrO3−(aq) ions, and from the \\nAgBrO3(s) that dissolves. The Na+(aq) from the NaBrO3(aq) is simply a specta-\\ntor ion and does not enter into any of our calculations here.\\n\\nIf we let s be the solubility of AgBrO3(s) in 0.10 M NaBrO3(aq), then we can \\nset up a concentration table as shown below.\\n\\nConcentration AgBrO3(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + BrO3−(aq)\\n\\ninitial\\n\\nchange\\n\\nequilibrium\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n—\\n\\n0 M\\n\\n+ s\\n\\ns\\n\\n0.10 M\\n\\n+ s\\n\\n0.10 M + s\\n\\nSubstituting the equilibrium values into Equation 22.4, we obtain\\n\\n s(0.10 M + s) = 5.4 × 10−5 M2 (22.5)\\n\\nBecause AgBrO3(s) is only sparingly soluble in pure water, we expect the value \\nof s in Equation 22.5 to be small compared to 0.10 M. In fact, the largest that \\ns can be is the solubility of AgBrO3(s) in pure water, which we calculated in \\nSection 22-1 to be 7.3 × 10−3 M. Le Châtelier’s principle shows that the solubility \\n\\nSee Interchapter O at  \\nwww.McQuarrieGeneralChemistry.com.\\n\\n\\n\\n22.

Therefore, we can neglect s relative to 0.10 M and write\\n\\ns(0.10 M) ≈ 5.4 × 10−5 M2\\n\\ns ≈ 5.4 × 10−4 M\\n\\nThe small value of [Ag+] justifies the assumption that s << 0.10 M. As a check, if \\nwe substitute s = 5.4 × 10−4 M into Equation 22.5, we find that it is satisfied. Thus, \\nwe see that the common ion, BrO3−(aq), decreases the solubility of AgBrO3(s). \\nThe solubility of AgBrO3(s) in pure water is 7.3 × 10−3 M, about 13 times greater \\nthan its solubility in a 0.10 M NaBrO3(aq) solution. The lowering of the solu-\\nbility of a salt by the presence of a common ion in the solution is called the \\ncommon ion effect.\\n\\nEXaMPlE 22-4: Calculate the solubility at 25°C in moles per liter of \\ncopper(II) iodate, Cu(IO3)2(s), (Ksp = 7.4 × 10−8 M3) in an aqueous solution \\nthat is 0.20 M in copper(II) perchlorate, Cu(ClO4)2(s), which is a strong \\nelectrolyte.\\n\\nSolution: The equilibrium equation that describes the solubility of \\nCu(IO3)2(s) in water is\\n\\nCu(IO3)2(s) ⇌ Cu2+(aq) + 2 IO3−(aq)\\n\\nand the corresponding solubility-product expression is\\n\\n Ksp = [Cu2+][IO3−]2 = 7.4 × 10−8 M3 (22.6)\\n\\nThe ClO4−(aq) from the Cu(ClO4)2(aq) is simply a spectator ion and does \\nnot enter into any of our calculations here. The only source of IO3−(aq) \\nis from the Cu(IO3)2(s) that dissolves. If we let s be the solubility of \\nCu(IO3)2(s) in 0.20 M Cu(ClO4)2(aq), then [IO3−] = 2s because two IO3−(aq) \\nions are produced for each formula unit of Cu(IO3)2(s) that dissolves. \\nThe Cu2+(aq) ions comes from both the 0.20 M Cu(ClO4)2(aq) and the \\nCu(IO3)2(s) that dissolves; thus, [Cu2+] = 0.20 M + s. If we substitute these \\nexpressions for [Cu2+] and [IO3−] into Equation 22.6, then we obtain\\n\\n (0.20 M + s)(2s)2 = 7.4 × 10−8 M3 (22.7)\\n\\nBecause Cu(IO3)2(s) is a slightly soluble salt, we expect the value of s to be \\nsmall. Therefore, we can neglect s relative to 0.20 M in Equation 22.7 and \\nwrite\\n\\n(0.20 M)(2s)2 ≈ 7.4 × 10−8 M3\\n\\nSolving for s yields\\n\\n7.4 × 10–8 M3\\n—\\n(0.20 M)(4)\\n\\ns ≈ = 3.0 × 10–4 M� �\\n1 ⁄ 2\\n\\nAs a check, we note that the value of s that we obtain is indeed negligible \\nrelative to 0.20 M.

Consider the equation for the solubility equilibrium for silver bromate,\\n\\nAgBrO3(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + BrO3−(aq)\\n\\nfor which\\n\\nKsp = [Ag+][BrO3−] = 5.4 × 10−5 M2\\n\\nAn increase in the concentration of BrO3−(aq)—for example, by adding \\nNaBrO3(s), a strong electrolyte, to the solution—shifts the solubility equilibrium \\nfrom right to left and thereby decreases the solubility of AgBrO3(s). The larger \\nthe value of [BrO3−] at equilibrium, the smaller the value of [Ag+] because the \\nproduct [Ag+][BrO3−] must equal 5.4 × 10−5 M2 at equilibrium at 25°C. Similarly, \\nan increase in the concentration of Ag+(aq)—for example, by adding AgNO3(s), \\nwhich is soluble in water—also shifts the solubility equilibrium from right to left \\nand thereby decreases the solubility of AgBrO3(s). The common ion effect for \\nAgBrO3(s) is illustrated in Figure 22.1.

This relation indicates that AgBrO3(s) is much more soluble in \\nNH3(aq) than in pure water.\\n\\nBecause Kc >> Ksp, we expect that essentially all the silver ions in solution \\nare in the form of the [Ag(NH3)2]+(aq) complex ion. Thus, we assume that \\n[Ag(NH3)2]+(aq), along with BrO3−(aq), are the principal species in the solution, \\nin the sense that their concentrations are large compared with the other spe-\\ncies in the solution. Because Equation 22.10 involves these species and because \\nKc >> Ksp, we can neglect Equation 22.9 and use Equation 22.10 to calculate \\nthe solubility of AgBrO3(s) in 0.50 M NH3(aq).

The concentration of Ag+(aq) is given by\\n\\nKsp = [Ag+][BrO3−] = [Ag+](0.25 M) = 5.4 × 10−5 M2\\n\\nso that\\n\\n[Ag+] = 2.2 × 10−4 M\\n\\nBecause all the dissolved silver from the AgBrO3(s) ends up as either Ag+(aq) \\nions or [Ag(NH3)2]+(aq) complex ions in the solution, the total solubility of \\nAgBrO3(s) is given by\\n\\ns = [Ag+] + [Ag(NH3)2+] = 2.2 × 10−4 M + 0.25 M = 0.25 M\\n\\nto two significant figures.

Figure 22.3 shows the \\nincrease in the solubility of AgBrO3(s) with the addition of NH3(aq).\\n\\nIf we try to calculate [NH3] by using 0.05 M – 2x from the concentration \\ntable, we find that [NH3] = 0.50 M – (2)(0.25 M) = 0 M.

Numerous acidic \\nbeverages, syrups, jams, jellies, and processed fruits contain about 0.1%  \\nsodium benzoate to prevent the growth of yeasts and harmful bacteria. Many \\nbenzoate salts are insoluble above pH = 4, and the formation of insoluble ben-\\nzoate salts at these higher pH values removes benzoate ions from solution, thus \\nrendering the benzoate ion ineffective as an antimicrobial agent. At pH ≤ 4, an \\nappreciable fraction of the benzoate ion exists as benzoic acid (Ka = 6.3 × 10−5 M \\nat 25°C), which is the biologically active form.\\n\\nWe shall use the benzoate salt, silver benzoate, AgC6H5COO(s), to illustrate \\nthe effect of pH on the solubility of a salt of a weak acid.

The Relative Magnitudes of Qsp and Ksp Can Be Used to \\nPredict Whether an Ionic Solid Can Precipitate\\n\\nIn Chapter 19, where we first studied chemical equilibria, we introduced a quan-\\ntity Q c called the reaction quotient. The reaction quotient has the same form as \\nan equilibrium constant, but is expressed in terms of arbitrary  concentrations. \\nWe showed that if Q c < Kc, then the reaction proceeds from left to right until \\nequilibrium is established, at which point Q c = Kc. Conversely, if Q c > Kc, then \\nthe reaction proceeds from right to left to equilibrium. We can use this same \\nidea here to determine whether a precipitate can form when two solutions are \\nadded to each other by defining Q sp as the concentration quotient for chemical \\nequations involving solubility equilibria.\\n\\nConsider the silver bromate solubility equilibrium described by the equation\\n\\n AgBrO3(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + BrO3−(aq) (22.17)\\n\\nfor which\\n\\nKsp = [Ag+][BrO3−] = 5.4 × 10−5 M2 \\n\\nand\\n\\nQ sp = [Ag+]0[BrO3−]0\\n\\nIf we prepare a solution with arbitrary values of [Ag+]0 and [BrO3−]0, then the \\n\\n\\n\\n831\\n\\ncriterion for whether or not AgBrO3(s) will precipitate depends on the relative \\nvalues of Q sp and Ksp. If Q sp > Ksp, then precipitation will occur until Q sp = Ksp, \\nthat is, until equilibrium is established. If, on the other hand, Q sp < Ksp, then \\nprecipitation will not occur and it is possible to dissolve additional AgBrO3(s) \\nuntil Q sp = Ksp and equilibrium is established. \\n\\nIf we already have a saturated solution of AgBrO3(aq) that is at equilibrium \\nand the equilibrium is disturbed in such a way that Q sp becomes less than Ksp, \\nthen additional AgBrO3(s) dissolves until the solution becomes saturated or all \\nthe AgBrO3(s) dissolves. These conditions are summarized in Table 22.2.\\n\\nFor example, suppose we mix 50.0 mL of 1.0 M AgNO3(aq) with 50.0 mL of \\n0.010 M NaBrO3(aq) at 25°C. Does AgBrO3(s) precipitate?

Once started, pre-\\ncipitation continues until Q sp = Ksp, that is, until equilibrium is attained.\\n\\nAlthough the relative values of Q sp and Ksp for a stated equation tell us whether \\nprecipitation is possible, they do not guarantee that precipitation will actually \\noccur. A situation may arise where the initial formation of crystals (nucleation) \\nis very slow, leading to a supersaturated solution (Figure 22.6).

Nonetheless, all the \\nchemical principles used in qualitative analysis are used by analytical chemists \\n(Figure 22.14).\\n\\nSUMMaRy\\n\\nThe solubility of an ionic solid is a measure of its concentration in a saturated \\nsolution. The equilibrium between the salt and the saturated solution is charac-\\nterized by a solubility-product constant, Ksp.\\n\\nThe solubility of a salt is less in a solution that contains one of its constituent \\nions than it is in pure water. For example, the solubility of AgCl(s) is less in 0.10 \\nM KCl(aq) than it is in pure water. The lowering of the solubility of a salt in a \\nsolution containing one of its constituent ions is called the common ion effect.\\n\\nMany metal ions in aqueous solution react with small molecules or ions \\nsuch as NH3(aq) or OH−(aq) to form complex ions. Complex ion formation can \\nenhance the solubility of compounds containing these metal ions. For exam-\\nple, the solubility of AgBrO3(s) is much greater in NH3(aq) than in pure water \\nbecause of the formation of a soluble [Ag(NH3)2]+(aq) complex ion.\\n\\nSlightly soluble salts containing an anion that is the conjugate base of a weak \\nacid become more soluble as the pH of the solution is lowered. The increase in \\nsolubility is a consequence of the protonation of the anion to form the weak \\nacid, which shifts the solubility equilibrium.\\n\\nThe relative values of the solubility-product constant, Ksp, and the solubility-\\nproduct quotient, Q sp, can be used to predict whether a salt dissolves in or pre-\\ncipitates out of a solution. If Q sp > Ksp, a precipitate will form; and if Q sp < Ksp, \\nno precipitate will form.\\n\\nSelective precipitation can often be used to separate ions in solution. \\nReasonable separations are achieved when each ion forms an insoluble salt with \\nthe same reactant and the values of Ksp of the two salts differ significantly.\\n\\nAmphoteric metal hydroxides are soluble in both acidic and basic solutions; \\nthe solubility of amphoteric metal hydroxides in strong bases is a consequence \\nof the formation of a soluble hydroxy ion complex of the metal ion.\\n\\nQualitative analysis schemes are based on the sequential separation of ions \\nin an unknown sample. The separated ions can be identified by their character-\\nistic chemical reactions. The pH dependence of the solubility of salts contain-\\ning the conjugate base of a weak acid, especially hydroxides and sulfides, can \\nbe used to achieve separations of various metal ions in qualitative analysis by \\nsuccessive adjustments of pH and addition of precipitating agents.\\n\\nfigure 22.14 Although chemists now \\noften use a variety of sophisticated \\nelectronic instruments in performing \\nchemical analyses, they still employ \\n“wet lab” chemical techniques in \\ncertain cases, such as shown here at \\nthe Smithsonian Institution.\\n\\n\\n\\nPRoBlEMS 845\\n\\nTERMS yoU SHoUlD knoW\\nsolubility 815\\nsolubility-product constant, Ksp 816\\ncommon ion 822\\ncommon ion effect 822\\ncomplex ion 823\\ncomplexation reaction 823\\nconcentration quotient, Q sp 830\\n\\nsupersaturated solution 831\\nselective precipitation 834\\namphoteric metal hydroxide 835\\nqualitative analysis 838\\nquantitative analysis 839\\nsupernatant 840\\n\\nEqUaTIonS yoU SHoUlD knoW HoW To USE\\n\\nFor any arbitrary ion concentrations:\\n\\nQ sp > Ksp\\nQ sp < Ksp\\n\\nprecipitate forms\\nno precipitate forms\\n\\nWhen equilibrium is disturbed:\\n\\nQ sp > Ksp\\nQ sp < Ksp\\n\\nmore precipitate forms until Q sp = Ksp\\nprecipitate dissolves either until Q sp = Ksp or until solid phase disappears\\n\\nPRoBlEMS\\n\\nREvIEW of SolUBIlITy RUlES\\n\\n22-1.

Gibbs \\nstudied at Yale and received his Ph.D. in engineering in 1863, the \\nsecond doctorate in science and the first in engineering awarded in \\nthe United States. He continued his engineering studies and in 1866 \\nreceived a patent for an improved railway brake. From 1866 to 1868, \\nhe studied in Paris, Berlin, and Heidelberg, and upon returning to \\nNew Haven, he began his studies of thermodynamics. He stayed on at \\nYale for years without salary, and remained there for the rest of his life. \\nIn 1878, Gibbs published a long, original treatise on thermodynamics \\nentitled, “On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances” in the \\nTransactions of the Connecticut Academy of Sciences. Between its austere \\nwriting style and the obscurity of the journal in which it was published, \\nthis important work was not as widely appreciated as it deserved to be. \\nFortunately, Gibbs sent copies to a number of prominent European \\nscientists, who immediately appreciated the significance of the \\nwork and made it known in Europe. Eventually, Gibbs received the \\nrecognition that was his due, and Yale finally offered him a salaried \\nposition in 1880. He is known as the founder of thermodynamics, \\nwhich is presented in courses today much as he formulated it over \\n150 years ago. His father died in 1855 and his mother died in 1861.  \\nAfterwards, Gibbs, an unassuming, modest person, lived in the family \\nhome with his sisters in New Haven, Connecticut, for most of his life.\\n\\n\\n\\n853\\n\\n23.

Why do some reactions occur spontaneously and others require a con-\\ntinuous input of energy from an external source? In this chapter, we discover \\nthe condition that must be met for a reaction to be spontaneous—a condition \\ncalled the criterion for reaction spontaneity.\\n\\nThe observation that all highly exothermic reactions are spontaneous led \\nthe French chemist Marcelin Berthelot to put forth, in the 1860s, the hypothesis \\nthat all spontaneous reactions are exothermic. Berthelot’s criterion of sponta-\\nneity for a chemical reaction was based on the sign of the enthalpy change for \\nthe reaction, DHrxn. According to Berthelot, if DHrxn is negative, then a reaction \\nis spontaneous.\\n\\nBerthelot’s criterion of reaction spontaneity was shown to be incorrect, how-\\never; and it was superseded by the criterion of reaction spontaneity developed by \\nthe American thermodynamicist J. Willard Gibbs (Frontispiece). Gibbs showed \\nthat reaction spontaneity is not just a matter of enthalpy changes. Another prop-\\nerty, called entropy, also must be considered when determining whether a reac-\\ntion is spontaneous. In this chapter, we shall discuss how the entropy concept \\nis based on a fundamental principle called the second law of thermodynamics. \\nWe shall also show that the Gibbs criterion of reaction spontaneity is given by \\nthe sign of a new quantity called the Gibbs energy change that depends on both \\nenthalpy and entropy changes for the reaction. In fact, as we shall see, the Gibbs \\nenergy change is equal to the maximum amount of energy in the form of work \\nthat can be extracted from a reaction system to perform tasks, such as propel-\\nling a rocket or powering an electric motor.\\n\\n23-1. Not All Spontaneous Reactions Evolve Energy\\nIn Chapter 14, we discussed enthalpy changes for chemical equations. Recall \\nthat an exothermic chemical reaction is one in which energy is evolved as \\n\\n\\n\\n23. ChEmiCAl ThERmodyNAmiCS854\\n\\nheat. Exothermic reactions go energetically downhill, in the sense that the \\ntotal enthalpy of the products is less than the total enthalpy of the reactants \\n(Figure 23.1). For an exothermic reaction, the enthalpy change, DHrxn, is nega-\\ntive. For an exothermic reaction run at standard conditions (all species at one \\nbar pressure, all solutes at one molar concentration), we have\\n\\nDH°rxn = H°[products] – H°[reactants] < 0  (exothermic)\\n\\nwhere the superscript degree signs denote standard  values for  the  thermody-\\nnamic quantities. Thus, DH°rxn is the standard enthalpy change for the equation.\\n\\nIn Chapter 14, we learned how to calculate DH°rxn from the values in a table \\nof enthalpies of formation (Table 14.3). Recall that the value of DH°rxn is approx-\\nimately equal to the value of the standard energy change, DU°rxn, for a reaction. \\nAlso, recall that DH°rxn ≈ DHrxn, because enthalpy is relatively independent of \\npressure.\\n\\nA process that takes place without the input of energy from an external source \\nis said to be spontaneous. The natural tendency of simple mechanical systems is \\nto undergo processes that lead to a decrease in the energy of the system. For \\nexample, water flows spontaneously downhill. Water at the bottom of a waterfall \\nhas a lower potential energy than water at the top. To get water back to the top of \\nthe waterfall, we have to use a pump, which requires energy input. Thus, the flow \\nof water uphill is not a spontaneous process.

The Second law of Thermodynamics places an Additional \\nRestriction on Energy Transfers\\n\\nThe only restriction placed on energy transfers by the first law of thermody-\\nnamics (Chapter 14) is the conservation of energy. We know from everyday \\nexperience, however, that there are other restrictions on energy transfers. For \\nexample, energy as heat always flows spontaneously from a region of higher \\ntemperature to a region of lower temperature. A piece of paper, once ignited, \\nburns spontaneously in oxygen, but the reverse process, that is, the spontane-\\nous recombination of the combustion products to the piece of paper and oxy-\\ngen gas, has never been observed in nature.

Spontaneous, unidirectional processes are \\noften referred to as irreversible processes.\\n\\nIn thermodynamics, we always distinguish between the system, that part of \\nthe universe where the change of interest occurs, and its surroundings, which \\nare the rest of the universe. Thermodynamics states that when a process occurs \\nspontaneously, the system and its surroundings cannot both be restored exactly \\nto their original states. If, for example, we restore the system to its initial state \\nby doing work on the system, then it is impossible to restore the surroundings \\nto its original state; if we restore the surroundings to its original state, then it \\nis impossible to restore the system to its original state. All naturally occurring \\nprocesses are in this sense irreversible. Nature is never exactly the same today \\nas it was yesterday. When a process occurs in nature, the universe is irreversibly \\nchanged.\\n\\nThe second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy, which is \\nembodied in the second law, arose from an analysis of the operation of heat \\nengines (especially steam engines) by the French engineer Sadi Carnot in the \\nearly 19th century. Carnot’s work led directly to the discovery of a new thermo-\\ndynamic state function (Sections 14-1 and 14-2) called entropy and given the \\nsymbol S that is closely associated with the transfer of energy as heat. The key \\nresult is most compactly expressed in the equation\\n\\n ∆Ssys ≥\\nqsys\\n—\\nTsys \\n\\n (23.1)\\n\\nEquation 23.1 is a mathematical statement of the second law of thermo\\xad\\ndynamics; it tells us that if energy is transferred either to or from a system as \\nheat, qsys, at the Kelvin temperature, Tsys, then the entropy change of the system, \\nDSsys, is greater than or equal to qsys/Tsys. The equality sign applies only if the \\nprocess is reversible. A reversible process is a process where the direction can \\nbe reversed at any point by an exceedingly small change in some parameter. For \\nexample, a temperature difference serves as the driving force for the flow of \\nenergy as heat from one object to another. \\n\\nSuppose we have two metals in contact. If the temperature of metal A is \\ngreater than that of metal B, then energy as heat will flow from metal A to metal \\nB. If the temperature of metal B is greater than that of metal A, then energy as \\nheat will flow from metal B to metal A. If the temperature difference is exceed-\\ningly small, then we can change the direction of the flow of energy by chang-\\ning the temperature difference slightly. In this case, we say that the process is \\nreversible. \\n\\nAnother example of a reversible process is the vaporization of a liquid at a \\ngiven pressure. If we increase the external pressure just slightly, then the liquid \\nwill condense, and if we decrease the external pressure just slightly, then the liq-\\nuid will vaporize. In this case, then, we can reverse the process of vaporization-\\ncondensation by a slight change in the external pressure. \\n\\nStrictly speaking, a reversible process is an idealization because the driving \\nforce (the temperature difference in the case of the two metals in contact or \\nthe pressure change in the case of vaporization-condensation of a liquid) has \\nto be infinitesimally small, which cannot be realized in practice. Consequently, \\nall naturally occurring processes are irreversible to some extent. The inequality \\nsign in Equation 23.1 applies to irreversible processes, or essentially to all pro-\\n\\n\\n\\n23. ChEmiCAl ThERmodyNAmiCS858\\n\\ncesses that occur naturally. Note from Equation 23.1 that the units of entropy are \\njoules per kelvin (J·K–1).\\n\\nEquation 23.1 takes on a simpler form for an isolated system, that is, a sys-\\ntem that cannot exchange energy with its surroundings, so that it can neither \\ndo work nor absorb energy as heat. We can picture an isolated system as one \\nwith rigid, thermally insulating, impermeable walls. For example, a liquid in a \\nstoppered Dewar flask is an example of an isolated system because it is enclosed \\nin a rigid, thermally insulating, impermeable container. For such a system, \\nqsys = 0 and Equation 23.1 becomes\\n\\n   DSsys = 0  (equilibrium in an isolated system) (23.2a)\\n\\nor\\n\\n DSsys > 0  (a spontaneous process in an isolated system) (23.2b)\\n\\nConsider an isolated system that is not in equilibrium. As the system under-\\ngoes spontaneous changes and inevitably evolves toward equilibrium, it contin-\\nually generates entropy until equilibrium is attained, at which point the entropy \\nwill achieve its maximum value (Figure 23.6). Unlike energy, entropy is not \\nconserved, and is generated by any spontaneously occurring process.\\n\\nWe can give another interpretation to Equations 23.2. Consider a system in \\ncontact with its surroundings, as illustrated in Figure 23.7. We can isolate the \\nsystem and its surroundings so that we can view the two as one isolated system \\nand write Equations 23.2 as\\n\\n DSsys + DSsurr = 0  (equilibrium) (23.3a)\\n\\nor\\n\\n DSsys + DSsurr > 0  (spontaneous process) (23.3b)\\n\\nBecause the most general example of a system and its surroundings includes \\nthe entire universe, and because all naturally occurring processes are spontane-\\nous, Equation 23.3b may also be expressed as DSuniverse > 0 for a spontaneous pro-\\ncess. Thus, the second law of thermodynamics tells us that the entropy of the \\nuniverse always increases when a natural process occurs. In fact, the first and \\nsecond laws of thermodynamics can be summarized in this pithy statement: The \\nenergy of the universe is constant and its entropy is continuously increasing.\\n\\nSpontaneous\\nprocesses\\n\\nS\\n\\nSmax\\n∆S = 0\\n\\nEquilibrium\\n\\nTime\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n04/07/10\\n\\n023-007\\n\\nSurroundings Heat\\nexchange\\n\\nSystem\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n03/20/10\\n\\n023-008\\n\\nFigure 23.6 As a system spontaneously \\nevolves toward equilibrium, it \\ncontinues to generate entropy until \\nequilibrium is reached, at which point \\nthe entropy is a maximum.\\n\\nFigure 23.7 A system in contact with its \\nsurroundings.\\n\\n\\n\\n23-2.

If it is negative, Equation 23.3 says that DSsurr \\nmust be positive to the extent that it at least cancels the negative contribution of \\nDSsys so that DSsys + DSsurr ≥ 0. This misunderstanding of the second law occasion-\\nally leads to bizarre interpretations, especially outside of the physical sciences.\\n\\nLet’s use Equation 23.1 to show that energy as heat will flow naturally from \\na region of high temperature to a region of low temperature. Consider the situ-\\nation in Figure 23.8 where two compartments at different temperatures, T1 and \\nT2, are in thermal contact, but are separated from their surroundings by a rigid, \\nthermally insulating, impermeable wall, so that this two-compartment system is \\neffectively isolated. The only flow of energy as heat will be from one compart-\\nment to the other. The entropy change of compartment 1 satisfies DS1 ≥ q1/T1 \\nand that of compartment 2 satisfies DS2 ≥ q2/T2. Therefore, the entropy change \\nof the two-compartment system satisfies\\n\\n ∆S = ∆S1 + ∆S2 ≥ +\\nq1—\\nT1 \\n\\nq2—\\nT2 \\n\\n (23.4)\\n\\nBecause q2 = –q1, that is, the energy gained as heat by one compartment is \\nequal to the energy lost as heat by the other, we can write Equation 23.4 as\\n\\n ∆S ≥ –\\nq1—\\nT1 \\n\\nq1—\\nT2 \\n\\n≥ q1� �–1—T1 \\n1\\n—\\nT2 \\n\\n (23.5)\\n\\nThe two-compartment system is isolated, so we can use Equations 23.2 to write\\n\\n ∆S ≥ ≥ 0q1� �–1—T1 \\n1\\n—\\nT2 \\n\\n (23.6)\\n\\nEquation 23.6 says that if the system is at equilibrium, then DS = 0, and, \\ntherefore, T1 = T2. If the system is not at equilibrium, then DS > 0. Let’s assume \\nfirst that q1 > 0, meaning that energy as heat flows from compartment 2 to com-\\npartment 1. In this case, the condition DS > 0 says that 1/T1 > 1/T2, or that \\nT2 > T1, meaning that energy as heat will flow spontaneously from compart-\\nment 2 to compartment 1 only if compartment 2 is at a higher temperature than \\n\\nCompartment 1\\nCompartment 2\\n\\nT1 T2\\n\\nHeat flow\\nHeat flow\\n\\nInsulator\\n\\nNo heat\\nexchange\\n\\nSurroundings\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n03/29/10 \\n\\n023-009\\n\\nFigure 23.8 Two compartments \\nin contact but isolated from their \\nsurroundings.\\n\\n\\n\\n23.

If, on the other hand, q1 < 0, meaning that energy as heat flows \\nfrom compartment 1 to compartment 2, then the condition DS > 0 requires that \\nT1 > T2, as you should expect.\\n\\nActually, the second law of thermodynamics is quite profound and has \\nmany consequences. Equation 23.1 may appear to be innocent enough because \\nit has only three variables, but it is not. One of the many implications of the \\nsecond law of thermodynamics is that you have to transfer energy as heat from \\na high-temperature region to a low-temperature region in order to convert heat \\nenergy into mechanical energy. Problem 23-88 has you show that the amount \\nof mechanical energy (or work, w) that you can extract from a given amount of \\nenergy as heat (q) must satisfy the relation\\n\\n <\\nT2 – T1—\\n\\nT2 \\nw\\n—\\nq\\n\\n (23.7)\\n\\nwhere T2 is the temperature of the high-temperature region and T1 is that of \\nthe low-temperature region. Notice that if the two temperatures are the same, \\nthen no mechanical energy is produced, that is, w/q = 0. Also notice that \\nEquation 23.7 says that it is not possible to convert all the energy as heat into \\nmechanical energy (w/q  = 1), unless T1 = 0 K, which is essentially an unattain-\\nable temperature. Thus, we see that the second law of thermodynamics imposes \\nsevere restrictions on the conversion of energy as heat into mechanical energy. \\nOne sad consequence of this restriction is that even though your car is sur-\\nrounded by the atmosphere, containing a vast amount of thermal energy, it is \\nof no use for powering your car because your car and the atmosphere are at the \\nsame temperature. Nevertheless, the allure of getting something for nothing is \\nso irresistible that patent offices around the world are beset with proposals of \\nsuch devices, many of which are wonderfully ingenious. But alas, they are ulti-\\nmately shown to violate the second law of thermodynamics.\\n\\nThe concept of entropy also can be developed in molecular terms. In the \\nnext few sections, we shall see how the entropy concept gives us insight into \\nchemical reactivity.\\n\\n23-3.  Entropy may Be Considered as a measure of the Amount of \\ndisorder or Randomness in a System\\n\\nOn a molecular level, it is sometimes convenient to consider the entropy of a \\nsubstance to be a quantitative measure of the amount of disorder. Disorder is \\nof two types: positional disorder that refers to the distribution of the particles \\nin space, and thermal disorder that refers to the distribution of the available \\nenergy among the particles. Any process that produces a more random distribu-\\ntion of the particles in space gives rise to an increase in the total entropy of the \\nsubstance. Any constant-pressure process that increases the temperature of \\nthe particles also gives rise to an increase in the total entropy of the substance.\\n\\nAs a simple example of an increase in positional disorder, consider the \\nisothermal (constant temperature) expansion of a gas into a vacuum, as illus-\\ntrated in Figure 23.9. When the stopcock between the bulb containing the gas \\non the left and the evacuated bulb on the right is opened, the gas expands to fill \\nboth bulbs. When equilibrium is attained, the gas occupies both bulbs instead \\n\\n\\n\\n23-3. ENTRopy mAy BE CoNSidEREd A mEASuRE oF diSoRdER 861\\n\\nof just one and so has greater positional disorder. This increase in positional \\ndisorder is accompanied by an increase in entropy, which is the driving force \\nfor this process.\\n\\nNow let’s consider a process that involves an increase in both positional dis-\\norder and thermal disorder. Figure 23.10 shows the molar entropy of oxygen \\nplotted against temperature from 0 K to 300 K. The entropy is zero at 0 K. At \\nthis temperature (absolute zero), there is no positional disorder because the \\nO2 molecules in the crystal are perfectly arrayed in the lattice. Nor is there any \\nthermal disorder because all the molecules are in the lowest possible energy \\nstate. Entropy is associated with disorder—no disorder, no entropy. The state-\\nment that the entropy of a perfect crystalline substance is zero at absolute zero \\nis known as the third law of thermodynamics. Absolute zero (0 K) is a theoreti-\\ncal state that can never be reached in practice, although temperatures as low as \\n100 picokelvin have been achieved by some experimenters (Figure 23.11).\\n\\nAs the temperature is increased from 0 K, the oxygen molecules begin to \\nvibrate more freely about their lattice sites.

ChEmiCAl ThERmodyNAmiCS862\\n\\nan increase in thermal disorder that leads to an increase in entropy (Figure \\n23.10). This increase in entropy is associated with the greater amount of energy \\nthat must be distributed among the molecules. We learned in Chapter 9 that \\nmolecules, like atoms, are restricted to discrete, quantized energy levels. The \\ngreater the amount of energy stored in a substance, the greater the number of \\nways in which the energy can be distributed among these levels, and thus the \\ngreater the thermal disorder and the greater the entropy.\\n\\nFigure 23.10 also shows that at fixed pressure, the entropy of liquid and gas-\\neous oxygen, like that for solid oxygen, increases as the temperature increases. As \\nthe temperature increases, the motions of the liquid and the gaseous oxygen mol-\\necules become more vigorous. The average molecular speed increases with tem-\\nperature (Section 13-10), and this increased molecular speed leads to an increase \\nin thermal disorder, which is the molecular basis for the increase in entropy.\\n\\nAlthough the entropy of a particular phase increases smoothly with increas-\\ning temperature due to its increasing thermal disorder with increasing tem-\\nperature, at a phase transition there is a jump in entropy. Let’s investigate the \\norigin of the two entropy jumps in Figure 23.10. When solid oxygen melts at \\n54.36 K, the solid in an ordered lattice breaks down into a liquid, where the \\nmolecules no longer are confined to lattice sites. Each molecule moves through-\\nout the liquid volume, so there is an increase in the positional disorder of the \\noxygen (Figure 23.12). This increase in positional disorder leads to an increase \\nin entropy. Because all the entropy increase occurs at the melting point, which \\nis a fixed temperature, DS of melting (fusion) appears as a vertical jump in \\nFigure 23.10. A jump also occurs at the boiling point because the molecules in \\nthe gas phase can move throughout a much larger volume than the molecules \\nin the liquid phase.

ChEmiCAl ThERmodyNAmiCS864\\n\\nWe can use Equation 23.1 to calculate the change in the entropy of one \\nmole of a substance upon fusion, called the molar entropy of fusion and writ-\\nten as DSfus. Because melting (as well as vaporization) can be carried out under \\nessentially reversible conditions (recall that we can make the substance freeze \\nor melt by changing the external pressure by a very small amount), we use the \\nequality sign in Equation 23.1, together with the relation qp = DHfus, to obtain\\n\\n ∆Sfus =\\n∆Hfus—\\nTm \\n\\n (23.8)\\n\\nIn Equation 23.8, DHfus is the molar enthalpy of fusion (Chapter 15) and Tm is \\nthe melting point in kelvin. From Equation 23.8 and Table 15.3, we find that the \\nentropy increase of one mole of oxygen upon melting at 54.36 K (the normal \\nmelting point of oxygen) is\\n\\n∆Sfus =\\n∆Hfus—\\nTm \\n\\n= 8.1 J·K–1·mol–1=\\n440 J·mol–1\\n—\\n\\n54.36 K\\n\\nNote that DSfus is positive. As expected, the molar entropy of liquid oxygen is \\ngreater than the molar entropy of solid oxygen. We expected it to be greater, \\nbut we didn’t predict by how much.\\n\\nWe can calculate the change in the entropy of a substance upon vaporiza-\\ntion by using a formula that is analogous to Equation 23.8. If we let DSvap be the \\nentropy change of one mole of a substance on vaporization, called the molar \\nentropy of vaporization, then using Equation 23.1 and the fact that qp = DHvap, \\nwe have\\n\\n ∆Svap =\\n∆Hvap\\n—\\n\\nTb \\n (23.9)\\n\\nwhere DHvap is the molar enthalpy of vaporization (Chapter 15) and Tb is the \\nboiling point in kelvin. Using Equation 23.9 and Table 15.3, we find that the \\nchange in the entropy of one mole of liquid oxygen upon being vaporized at \\n90.20 K (the normal boiling point of oxygen) is\\n\\n∆Svap =\\n∆Hvap\\n—\\n\\nTb \\n= 75.6 J·K–1·mol–1=\\n\\n6820 J·mol–1\\n—\\n\\n90.20 K\\n\\nObserve that DSvap is positive. As expected, the molar entropy of gaseous oxygen \\nis greater than the molar entropy of liquid oxygen. Notice also that DSvap > DSfus \\nbecause the molecules in the gas phase are much more positionally disordered \\nthan the molecules in the liquid or the solid phase. This order of magnitude is \\na general result.\\n\\nEXAmplE 23-2: The molar enthalpy of fusion of water is DHfus = \\n6.01 kJ·mol–1 at 0°C, and the molar enthalpy of vaporization of water is \\nDHvap = 40.65 kJ·mol–1 at 100°C.

Because the molar entropy is \\nzero at 0 K—by the third law of thermodynamics—we can establish a scale of \\nabsolute molar entropy values. Recall that the superscript degree sign on a \\nthermodynamic quantity tells us that it is the value at standard conditions—\\nthat is, at exactly one bar pressure and, for solutes, at a concentration of exactly \\none molar. Table 23.1 gives the standard molar entropies of substances at 25°C, \\ndenoted by S°. Table 23.1 also contains values of some other thermodynamic \\nquantities (DH°f and DG°f) that cannot be specified absolutely. We shall learn \\nabout DG°f values in Section 23-9.\\n\\nThe molar entropy of a gas or solute depends strongly on concentration \\nbecause of the change in positional disorder with concentration. This property \\nof entropy differs sharply from enthalpy, which is relatively insensitive to pres-\\nsure or concentration.\\n\\nLet’s look at the standard molar entropy values in Table 23.1 and try to \\ndetermine some trends. First notice that the values of the molar entropies of the \\ngaseous substances are the largest, and the values of the molar entropies of the \\nsolid substances are the smallest. We have already discussed the reason for this.\\n\\nNow consider the standard molar entropies of the noble gases. The values \\nat standard conditions and 25°C are given in Table 23.2. The increase in molar \\nentropy of the noble gases is a consequence of their increasing mass as we move \\ndown the periodic table. It is known from quantum theory that the greater \\nthe molecular mass, the more closely spaced are the energy levels. Thus, an \\nincrease in mass leads to an increase in thermal disorder (more quantum levels \\n\\nA more complete listing of \\nthermodynamic data appears \\nin Appendix d.\\n\\n\\n\\n23.

DS°rxn Equals the Standard Entropy of the products minus the \\nStandard Entropy of the Reactants\\n\\nConsider the general chemical equation\\n\\naA + bB → yY + zZ (23.10)\\n\\nWe define the standard entropy change for a chemical equation, DS°rxn, as\\n\\n DS°rxn = S°[products] – S°[reactants] (23.11)\\n\\nApplication of Equation 23.11 to Equation 23.10 yields\\n\\n DS°rxn = yS°[Y] + zS°[Z] – aS°[A] – bS°[B] (23.12)\\n\\nwhere the brackets serve to separate the formula of the compound from the \\nsymbol S°.\\n\\nWe can use the values of the standard molar entropies from Table 23.1 to \\ncalculate the value of the standard entropy change of a reaction, DS°rxn. Let’s use \\nEquation 23.12 to calculate the value of DS°rxn at 25°C for the equation\\n\\nCO(g) + 3 H2(g) → CH4(g) + H2O(g)\\n\\nFrom Equation 23.12 we have\\n\\nDS°rxn = S°[CH4(g)] + S°[H2O(g)] – S°[CO(g)] – 3S°[H2(g)]\\n\\nFrom Table 23.1 we obtain\\n\\nDS°rxn  = (1)(186.3 J·K–1·mol–1) + (1)(188.8 J·K–1·mol–1)\\n   – (1)(197.7 J·K–1·mol–1) – (3)(130.7 J·K–1·mol–1)\\n\\n= –214.7 J·K–1·mol–1\\n\\nThere is a large negative change in entropy for this reaction because there \\nare only two moles of gaseous products but four moles of gaseous reactants. \\nAt the same temperature and pressure, the volume of the products will be \\nonly about one-half the volume of the reactants. The reactant state has more \\npositional disorder than the product state, so the entropy of the products is less \\nthan that of the reactants.

The volume, and hence the positional disorder of the products, is \\nmuch greater than the positional disorder of the reactants at the same tempera-\\nture and pressure. Using data from Table 23.1, we obtain\\n\\nDS°rxn  = 2 S°[H2(g)] + S°[O2(g)] – 2 S°[H2O(l)]\\n= (2)(130.7 J·K–1·mol–1) + (1)(205.2 J·K–1·mol–1) – (2)(70.0 J·K–1·mol–1)\\n\\n= +326.6 J·K–1·mol–1\\n\\nWe see that DS°rxn is positive, just as we predicted. In general, the greater the \\ndifference between the total number of moles of gaseous products and the total \\nnumber of moles of gaseous reactants, the greater is the value of DS°rxn.\\n\\n23-6. The Sign of DGrxn determines Reaction Spontaneity\\nThe ill-fated principle of Berthelot that we discussed in the introduction to \\nthe chapter stated that a reaction has to be exothermic to be spontaneous. \\nBerthelot reasoned that reactions evolving energy are spontaneous because the \\nproducts are energetically downhill from the reactants. However, we have seen \\nthat there are spontaneous reactions in which the products either are energeti-\\ncally uphill from the reactants (such as the spontaneous melting of ice) or have \\nessentially the same energy as the reactants (such as the spontaneous mixing \\nof gases). Such reactions are said to be entropy\\xaddriven reactions. A reaction for \\nwhich the total entropy of the products is greater than the total entropy of the \\nreactants (DS°rxn > 0) is an entropy\\xadfavored reaction.\\n\\nWhen the energy of the products is less than the energy of the reactants \\n(DHrxn ≈ DUrxn < 0), the reaction is said to be energy favored. If there is little \\nor no change in entropy (DS°rxn ≈ 0), then a system will change in such a way \\nthat its energy is decreased. Once the energy of the system is minimized, the \\nsystem no longer changes and is at equilibrium. The simple mechanical exam-\\nples of energy minimization for spontaneous processes that we discussed in \\nSection 23-1 (for example, water or a ball moving downhill) are spontaneous \\nprocesses for which there is little or no change in entropy.\\n\\nIn contrast, if there is little or no change in energy (DHrxn ≈ DUrxn ≈ 0), then \\na system will change in such a way that its entropy increases. When the entropy \\nof the system is maximized, the system no longer changes and is at equilibrium. \\nThe mixing of two gases is a good example of this case. The gases mix sponta-\\nneously because the entropy of the final state (the mixture) is greater than the \\nentropy of the initial state (separate gases). You may have had some idea that \\nsystems try to minimize energy, but the idea of entropy maximization may be \\nnew to you. Both ideas are equally important, however.\\n\\nAll processes that are both energy favored and entropy favored are sponta-\\n\\n23-6. ThE SiGN oF DGRXN dETERmiNES REACTioN SpoNTANEiTy\\n\\n\\n\\n23.

But what \\nabout the many processes for which the energy (enthalpy) and entropy factors \\noppose each other? In fact, many reactions have values of DHrxn and DSrxn that \\noppose each other. For such cases, we have either\\n\\n(1)  DHrxn > 0  and  DSrxn > 0\\n\\nor\\n\\n(2)  DHrxn < 0  and  DSrxn < 0\\n\\nCase (1) is entropy favored but energy disfavored; case (2) is energy favored but \\nentropy disfavored. Such reactions may or may not be spontaneous, depending \\non the temperature and on the relative magnitudes of DHrxn and DSrxn.\\n\\nThe spontaneity of such reactions was explained over 100 years ago by \\nJ. Willard Gibbs, one of America’s greatest scientists (Frontispiece). Gibbs \\nintroduced a quantity now called the Gibbs energy, G, which, as we shall show, \\nserves as a compromise between the enthalpy change and the entropy change \\nof a reaction. For a reaction run at a constant temperature, the Gibbs energy \\nchange, DGrxn, is given by\\n\\n DGrxn = DHrxn – TDSrxn (23.13)\\n\\nwhere T  is the Kelvin temperature.\\nChemical reactions are forced by nature to seek a compromise between \\n\\nenergy minimization and entropy maximization. For a reaction that occurs at \\na constant temperature and pressure, the nature of the compromise is given by \\nthe sign and magnitude of DGrxn. The Gibbs criteria for reaction spontaneity \\nare as follows:\\n\\n 1.  If DGrxn < 0, the reaction is spontaneous and additional products can form.\\n 2.  If DGrxn > 0, the reaction is not spontaneous and no additional products can \\n\\nform without the input of energy from an external source. Without such an \\ninput of energy, the reverse reaction will be spontaneous.\\n\\n 3.  If DGrxn = 0, the reaction is at equilibrium and no further net change occurs.\\n\\nWhen we say the reaction is spontaneous, we are referring to the reaction as \\nwritten and are using the word spontaneous to mean progressing naturally in the \\nforward direction (that is, from reactants toward products, or from left to right) \\nwithout the input of energy from an external source.\\n\\nThe spontaneous mixing of two gases (Figure 23.4) and the spreading of a \\ndrop of ink throughout a volume of water (Figure 23.16) are examples of pro-\\ncesses for which DH ≈ 0 and DS > 0. For these processes,\\n\\nDG = DH – TDS ≈ 0 – TDS < 0\\n\\nso the Gibbs criteria predict that two gases mix spontaneously and that a drop of \\nink becomes uniformly dispersed throughout a volume of water. Furthermore, \\nnote that DG > 0 for the reverse processes because DS < 0 for the reverse processes. \\nTherefore, the Gibbs criteria predict that we shall never see the reverse processes \\n\\nFigure 23.16 The dispersal of ink \\nthroughout the entire volume of \\nwater is an example of a spontaneous \\nprocess.\\n\\n\\n\\n871\\n\\noccur spontaneously; we shall never see two gases separate spontaneously, nor a \\ndispersal of ink in water revert spontaneously to its undispersed state.\\n\\nEquation 23.8 says that DSfus = DHfus/Tm. When we substitute this result into \\nEquation 23.13, then we see that DG fus = 0. At the standard melting point, the \\nsolid and liquid phases are in equilibrium with each other, and thus DG fus = 0, \\nas the third Gibbs criteria states. It should be clear that this should also be the \\ncase at the boiling point, and so DG vap = 0 (see Equation 23.9).\\n\\nLet’s consider the melting point of a substance once again, which we \\ndescribe by\\n\\n A(s) ⇌ A(l ) (23.14)\\n\\nFor this process, Equation 23.13 can be written as\\n\\n DG fus = DHfus – TmDSfus = 0 (23.15)\\n\\nIf the temperature is raised slightly above Tm, then DG fus < 0 (assuming DHfus and \\nDSfus do not vary much with temperature). Thus, according to the first of the \\nGibbs spontaneity criteria, the process described by Equation 23.14 is spontane-\\nous, and the substance melts, as we should expect since we raised the tempera-\\nture. If we lower the temperature slightly below Tm, then Equation 23.15 says \\nthat DG fus > 0. According to the second of the Gibbs spontaneity criteria, the \\nreverse of Equation 23.14 occurs spontaneously, and the substance freezes, as \\nwe should expect since we lowered the temperature.\\n\\nIn the case of fusion or vaporization, both DHrxn and DSrxn are positive, and \\nso we see that the reaction will proceed spontaneously when the temperature is \\nsufficiently high so that the value of the –TDSrxn term in DGrxn = DHrxn – TDSrxn \\ncauses the value of DGrxn to be less than zero. Table 23.4 summarizes the differ-\\nent cases for determining reaction spontaneity that we have discussed here.\\n\\nHighly exothermic processes, like most combustion reactions, have large \\nnegative values of DHrxn. In such cases the DHrxn < 0 term in Equation 23.13 \\ntends to dominate the –TDSrxn term, even when DSrxn < 0. Thus, for combustion \\nreactions or other highly exothermic reactions, DHrxn is generally an adequate \\ncriterion of reaction spontaneity. It was in his generalization of this observation \\nto all reactions that Berthelot erred.\\n\\nTABlE 23.4 Spontaneity criteria for the equation \\nDGrxn = DHrxn – TDSrxn at constant pressure.\\n\\nDHrxn DSrxn Reaction spontaneity*\\n\\n< 0 > 0 always spontaneous (DGrxn < 0)\\n\\n< 0 < 0 spontaneous (DGrxn < 0) when |DHrxn| > |TDSrxn|\\n\\n> 0 > 0 spontaneous (DGrxn < 0) when |TDSrxn| > |DHrxn|\\n\\n> 0 < 0 never spontaneous (DGrxn > 0)\\n\\n*Vertical lines (e.g. |DHrxn|) denote magnitude or absolute value.\\n\\n23-6.

Thus, the reaction will be spontaneous when \\nTDSvap > DHvap because the value of DG vap will be less than zero.\\n\\n(b) This is a combustion reaction and is highly exothermic.

How are plants able to use the \\nreaction described by this equation to produce glucose?\\n\\nAnswer: This reaction is not spontaneous under any conditions. Plants use \\nenergy from the sun (photosynthesis) to drive the reaction and produce \\nglucose. A nonspontaneous reaction will only form products upon the input \\nfrom an external source of the energy needed to drive the reaction.\\n\\nIn general, a system will change spontaneously in such a way that its Gibbs \\nenergy is minimized. The Gibbs energy of a substance consists of an enthalpy \\nterm and an entropy term. The enthalpy term is fairly independent of pressure \\n(for a gaseous species) or concentration (for a species in solution), but as we \\nshowed in Section 23-3, the entropy term depends strongly on these quantities. \\nIn any spontaneous process, the composition of a system will change through \\nthe consumption of some species and the formation of others, thereby chang-\\ning their pressures or concentrations so that the Gibbs energy of the system is \\nminimized.\\n\\n\\n\\n873\\n\\n23-7.  The Reaction Quotient, Equilibrium Constant, and DG°rxn Are \\nRelated\\n\\nIn Chapter 19 we presented another set of criteria that govern the direction in \\nwhich a chemical reaction proceeds. These criteria involve the ratio of the reac-\\ntion quotient Q c to the equilibrium constant Kc. Recall that for a given reaction \\nequation we have the following:\\n\\n 1.  If Q c/Kc > 1 or Q c > Kc, the reaction proceeds spontaneously from right to left.\\n\\n 2.  If Q c/Kc < 1 or Q c < Kc, the reaction proceeds spontaneously from left to right.\\n\\n 3. If Q c/Kc = 1 or Q c =Kc, the reaction is at equilibrium.\\n\\nSimilar relations apply to Q p and Kp.\\nBecause the sign of DGrxn also determines whether a reaction is spontaneous, \\n\\nwe should expect a relation between DGrxn and Q c/Kc or Q p/Kp; the relation is\\n\\n \\nQc—\\nKc\\n\\nor� �∆Grxn = RT  ln Qp—Kp� �∆Grxn = RT  ln  (23.16)\\nBecause the units of Q c and Kc are the same, the units cancel in the ratio Q c/Kc \\nand similarly for Q p/Kp. Also note the following from Equation 23.16:\\n\\n 1. If Q c/Kc > 1, then DGrxn = RT ln(Q c/Kc) > 0 and so DGrxn is positive.\\n 2. If Q c/Kc < 1, then DGrxn = RT ln(Q c/Kc) < 0 and so DGrxn is negative.\\n 3. If Q c/Kc = 1, then DGrxn = RT ln(Q c/Kc) = 0 and so DGrxn is zero.\\n\\nSimilar relations are true for Q p and Kp.\\nIn applying the Gibbs criteria to a reaction, it is worth remembering that \\n\\neven when a reaction is spontaneous, it may not occur at a detectable rate. \\nSpontaneous is not synonymous with immediate. On the other hand, if DGrxn > 0,  \\nthen the reaction will not occur in the absence of an input of energy from an \\nexternal source under the prevailing conditions. The no  of thermodynamics \\nis emphatic; the yes  of thermodynamics is actually a maybe. For a reaction to \\noccur spontaneously, it is absolutely necessary  that DGrxn < 0; however, a negative \\nvalue of DGrxn is not sufficient to guarantee that the reaction will occur at a \\ndetectable rate. In order to determine the rate of a reaction, we must apply the \\nconcepts discussed in Chapters 17 and 18 on chemical kinetics. For example, a \\nsizeable energy barrier may effectively prevent a reaction from occurring (see \\nSection 18-2), even though DGrxn is negative and the reaction is thermodynami-\\ncally spontaneous.\\n\\nThe following Example illustrates the use of Equation 23.16.\\n\\nEXAmplE 23-5: The reaction system described by the chemical equation\\n\\n2HI(g) ⇌ H2(g) + I2(g)\\n\\nis prepared at 598 K with the initial pressures PHI = 0.500 bar, PH2 = 0.150 bar, \\nand PI2 = 4.25 × 10\\n\\n–2 bar.

Is your result consistent with the common ion effect discussed in \\nChapter 22?\\n\\nAnswer: DGrxn = +14 kJ·mol–1; yes\\n\\nAt this point, you may think that the introduction of DGrxn has not given us \\nanything new because we can determine the direction in which a reaction will \\nproceed spontaneously by simply using the value of Q c/Kc. But what if we are not \\ngiven the value of the equilibrium constant? We shall show later in this chapter \\nthat we can use Equation 23.16 to calculate the value of the equilibrium con-\\nstant for a reaction described by a given chemical equation and thus determine \\nreaction spontaneity. Another advantage of introducing DGrxn is that the value \\nof DGrxn is related to the energy that can be obtained as work from a process. \\nIf DGrxn is negative (spontaneous reaction), then its magnitude is equal to the \\n\\n\\n\\n875\\n\\nmaximum energy that can be obtained from the reaction to perform work, such \\nas moving a piston. For example, the value of DGrxn at 25°C for the reaction \\ndescribed by\\n\\n2 H2(g, 1 bar) + O2(g, 1 bar) → 2 H2O(l)\\n\\nis −474.2 kJ·mol–1. This reaction can provide a maximum of 474.2 kJ·mol–1 of \\nenergy to an external device, such as an electric motor. This maximum amount \\nof energy is an ideal value. In practice we always obtain less than the maximum \\namount.\\n\\nIf DGrxn is positive, then its value is the minimum energy that must be supplied \\nto the reaction in order to make it occur. For instance, Example 23-5 shows that \\nDGrxn = +4.27 kJ·mol–1 at 598 K for the reaction described by the equation\\n\\n2 HI(g, 0.500 bar) ⇌ H2(g, 0.150 bar) + I2(g, 0.0425 bar)\\n\\nThus, we must supply at least 4.27 kJ·mol–1 to make the reaction occur under \\nthe stated conditions.\\n\\n23-8.

The numerical value of Q°c is unity, \\nand its units, by convention, are expressed using concentrations in molarity. \\nTherefore, K has the same numerical value as Kc, but is unitless because the \\nunits of Kc and the units of Q°c cancel.\\n\\nWe can also use the second expression in Equation 23.16 to define a ther-\\nmodynamic equilibrium constant in terms of Kp instead of Kc. By analogy with \\nEquation 23.17, we write\\n\\n \\nKp\\n—\\nQ°p\\n\\nK  =  (23.18)\\n\\nwhere Q°p has a numerical value of unity, and its units are expressed using bars. \\nThus, K and Kp have the same numerical value, but K is unitless.\\n\\nEXAmplE 23-6: The value of Kc for the equation\\n\\nCH3COO–(aq) + H2O(l ) ⇌ CH3COOH(aq) + OH−(aq)\\n\\nis 5.6 × 10–10 M at 25°C.

The fact that DG°rxn is positive does not mean that no CH3COOH(aq) dis-\\nsociates when we dissolve acetic acid in water at 25°C. Some CH3COOH(aq) \\ndoes dissociate because it is DGrxn, not  DG°rxn, that determines whether a reaction \\noccurs. The value of DGrxn at 25°C for the dissociation of CH3COOH(aq) in \\nwater is given by Equation 23.20 as\\n\\nDGrxn = DG°rxn + RT  ln Q  = 27.1 kJ·mol–1 + (2.48 kJ·mol–1)ln Q\\n\\nwhere Q  is the thermodynamic reaction quotient.\\nLet’s consider a 0.050 M CH3COOH(aq) solution. Initially (at the instant of \\n\\nmixing), [CH3COOH]0 = 0.050 M, [H3O+]0 ≈ 1.0 × 10−7 M, and [CH3COO−]0 ≈ \\n0 M. Thus, if we let Q 0 be the initial value of Q ,\\n\\nQ 0 = ≈ 0\\n([H3O+]0/M)([CH3COO–]0/M)—\\n\\n[CH3COOH]0/M\\n\\nBecause the logarithm of a very small number is a large negative number, the \\nvalue of DGrxn obtained from Equation 23.20 for this initial value of Q  is very \\nlarge and negative. Therefore, the dissociation of CH3COOH(aq) initially takes \\nplace spontaneously. The concentration of CH3COOH(aq) decreases and the \\nconcentrations of H3O+(aq) and CH3COO−(aq) increase until equilibrium is \\nreached. The equilibrium state is determined by the condition DGrxn = 0. If we \\nset DGrxn = 0 in Equation 23.20, then we obtain\\n\\nDG°rxn = –RT  ln Q eq  (at equilibrium)\\n\\nwhich, when compared with Equation 23.19, gives\\n\\nQ eq = K  (at equilibrium)\\n\\nWe can show this behavior graphically. Figure 23.17 shows DGrxn plotted \\n\\n\\n\\n879\\n\\nagainst [H3O+]/M for the dissociation of 0.050 M CH3COOH(aq) at 25°C. \\nYou can see from the figure that DGrxn is large and negative initially and then \\nincreases with increasing [H3O+] until DGrxn = 0, where the reaction reaches \\nequilibrium. As we saw in Section 20-7, for a 0.050 M CH3COOH(aq) solution \\nat 25°C, the equilibrium concentrations of the various species in solution are \\n[H3O+] = [CH3COO–] = 9.4 × 10−4 M and [CH3COOH] = 0.050 M – 9.4 × 10−4 M \\n= 0.049 M. Substituting these values into the expression for Q eq gives\\n\\nQ eq  = K  = = = 1.8 × 10\\n–5(9.4 × 10\\n\\n–4)2\\n—\\n\\n0.049\\n\\n([H3O+]/M)([CH3COO–]/M)—\\n[CH3COOH]/M\\n\\nFigure 23.18 shows Q  plotted against [H3O+]/M for this same reaction, \\nshowing that Q  increases with increasing [H3O+] until Q  = K  = 1.8 × 10−5 when \\n[H3O+] = 9.4 × 10−4 M. Beyond this point, Q  > K  and the reaction is no lon-\\nger spontaneous. Figure 23.17 and Figure 23.18 say the very same thing, but \\nFigure 23.17 is expressed in terms of reaction criteria involving the sign of \\nDGrxn and Figure 23.18 is expressed in terms of reaction criteria involving the \\nrelative values of K  and Q.

The \\nmaximum amount of work will be obtained if the \\ncyclic process is carried out reversibly.

In 1943, he earned \\na B.S. in chemistry and in 1946 a Ph.D. from McGill University, doing experimental work on \\nchemical kinetics. Upon graduation, Marcus obtained a postdoctoral fellowship at the newly \\nformed National Research Council of Canada (NRC) studying the rate of photochemical \\nreactions. At this time, there was little to no theoretical chemistry being done in Canada, \\nand, together with a colleague, he began studying theoretical research papers. He had always \\nexcelled in mathematics and had taken extra mathematics courses at McGill. He realized that he \\nneeded to leave Canada to continue in theoretical chemistry, and so took a second postdoctoral \\nposition at the University of North Carolina in 1949, where he began to develop theories on the \\nrates of chemical reactions. While at North Carolina, he met his future wife, who was a graduate \\nstudent in sociology. In 1951, he took a position at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, where \\nhe developed the theory now known as “Marcus theory,” that describes the rate of electron-\\ntransfer (oxidation-reduction) reactions. In 1964, he joined the faculty of the University of \\nIllinois in Urbana-Champaign, concentrating on theoretical work. In 1978, he accepted an offer \\nfrom the California Institute of Technology as the Arthur Amos Noyes Professor of Chemistry, \\nwhere he remains today. Over his long and distinguished career, he has received numerous \\nhonors, including the National Medal of Science in 1989 and election to the National Academy \\nof Sciences in 1970, the Royal Society of London in 1978, and the Royal Society of Canada in \\n1993. In 1992, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry “for his contributions to the theory \\nof electron-transfer reactions in chemical systems.” Marcus believes that his experimental work \\nalways enriched his theoretical work.\\n\\n\\n\\n899\\n\\n24. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions\\n\\nA ll chemical reactions can be assigned to one of two classes: reactions in which electrons are transferred from one reactant to another and reac-\\ntions in which electrons are not transferred. We learned in Chapter 10 that \\nreactions in which electrons are transferred from one reactant to another are \\ncalled  oxidation-reduction reactions or electron-transfer reactions. Oxidation-\\nreduction reactions are important in many technological applications such as \\ncorrosion prevention, electroplating, batteries, photography, and combustion \\nreactions. Many reactions of biological significance such as photosynthesis, res-\\npiration, the transport of energy within the body, the prevention of food spoil-\\nage, and even the aging of wine involve oxidation-reduction reactions (Figure \\n24.1).\\n\\nWe shall use the idea of oxidation states to determine whether a reaction \\ninvolves electron transfer and, if so, which species is oxidized and which spe-\\ncies is reduced. Much of this chapter is devoted to the use of oxidation states \\nto balance oxidation-reduction reaction equations. The final two sections of \\nthe chapter discuss oxidation-reduction reactions used in chemical analyses \\nand the corrosion of metals by oxidation-reduction reactions. A thorough un-\\nderstanding of oxidation-reduction reactions is an essential prerequisite to our \\nstudy of electrochemistry in the next chapter.\\n\\n24-1.  Oxidation-Reduction Reactions Involve the Transfer  \\nof Electrons Between Species\\n\\nWe learned in Chapter 10 that reactions in which electrons are transferred from \\none species to another are called oxidation-reduction reactions. Consider the \\nreaction of Na(s) with S(s) to produce the ionic compound sodium sulfide, \\nNa2S(s), which we discussed in Section 10-11 (Figure 24.2). The equation that \\ndescribes this reaction is\\n\\n \\n\\n2(0)\\n\\n2 Na(s) + S(s) → Na2S(s)\\n\\n(0) (–2)\\n\\n2(+1)\\n\\nEach Na atom donates\\none electron. Each S atom \\naccepts two electrons. \\n\\nNote that two sodium atoms react with one sulfur atom. The ionic charge of \\neach of the two sodium atoms goes from 0 to +1 and that of the sulfur atom \\n\\n 24-1 Oxidation States\\n 24-2 Oxidation-Reduction Reactions\\n 24-3 Half Reactions\\n 24-4  Balancing Equations for Oxidation-\\n\\nReduction Reactions in Acidic Solutions\\n\\n24-5  Balancing Equations for Oxidation-\\nReduction Reactions in Basic Solutions\\n\\n24-6  Oxidation-Reduction Reactions and \\nChemical Analysis\\n\\n24-7 Corrosion\\n\\nFigure 24.1  Port wine undergoes a \\ncolor change from ruby to tawny as it \\nages—an oxidation-reduction process \\ninvolving the anaerobic oxidation of \\nthe wine.\\n\\nFigure 24.2  Sodium reacts with sulfur to \\nproduce sodium sulfide, Na2S(s).\\n\\n\\n\\n24.

As this equation shows, the electron trans-\\nfer between species in a chemical equation must be balanced; that is, in any \\noxidation-reduction reaction the total number of electrons lost always equals \\nthe total number of electrons gained. The ionic products in this equation have \\na noble-gas configuration (margin). The stability of these ions accounts for the \\ndriving force of this reaction; we go from relatively reactive reactants to rela-\\ntively stable products.\\n\\nWe can use the idea of ionic charge and the conservation of electrons \\nto determine the balancing coefficients in chemical equations involving \\n oxidation-reduction reactions. The concept of an ionic charge on an element \\nis so convenient in balancing oxidation-reduction equations that it has been \\ngeneralized. This type of ionic charge is called an oxidation state.\\n\\nWe can assign an oxidation state to each atom in a chemical species on the \\nbasis of a set of rules. The rules originate from a consideration of the number \\nof electrons in a neutral atom of an element relative to the number of electrons \\nthat we assign to that element when it is incorporated in a molecule or ion. In \\nthe case of monatomic ions (e.g., Na+, Ca2+, O2–, and Cl–), the assigned oxida-\\ntion state is simply equal to the ionic charge on the atomic ion. For chemical \\nspecies involving two or more atoms, the assigned oxidation states are often not \\nequal to the actual charges on the atoms. In such species, the assignment of \\noxidation states is, in essence, a bookkeeping device that is useful for identify-\\ning and balancing oxidation-reduction equations.\\n\\nRules for Assigning Oxidation States\\nThe general procedure for assigning oxidation states to elements in chemical \\nspecies containing two or more atoms is given by the following set of rules that \\ntake priority in the order given:\\n\\n 1. Free elements are assigned an oxidation state of 0.\\n 2.  The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a species must be equal \\n\\nto the net charge on the species.\\n 3.  The alkali metal atoms (Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) in compounds are always \\n\\nassigned an oxidation state of +1.\\n 4. Fluorine atoms in compounds are always  assigned an oxidation state of –1.\\n 5.  The alkaline-earth atoms (Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, and Ra) and Zn and Cd in \\n\\ncompounds are always  assigned an oxidation state of +2.\\n 6. Hydrogen atoms in compounds are assigned an oxidation state of +1.\\n 7. Oxygen atoms in compounds are assigned an oxidation state of –2.\\n 8.  The preceding seven rules can be used to determine oxidation states in \\n\\nmany but not all cases. For those cases where these rules are not suffi-\\ncient, we can always use Lewis formulas to determine oxidation states. This \\nmethod is more cumbersome to apply, but it is very general and covers all \\nsituations. We assign oxidation states by the following additional four steps:\\na. Write the Lewis formula for the molecule or ion.\\nb.  Assign all the electrons in each bond to the more electronegative atom \\n\\nin the bond (Table 24.1). If the two atoms have identical electronega-\\ntivities, then divide the bonding electrons equally between them.\\n\\n2 Na+\\n2–\\n\\nS+ +2 Na S\\n\\n[Ne][Ne]3s23p4[Ne]3s1 [Ne]3s23p6\\n\\nor [Ar]\\n\\n\\n\\n90124-1. OxIdATIOn STATES\\n\\nc.  Add up the total number of valence electrons assigned to each atom in \\nstep 8b.\\n\\nd.  Assign an oxidation state to each main-group element  in the species ac-\\ncording to the formula\\n\\n  \\n\\nnumber of valence\\nelectrons in the free\\n(nonbonded) atom\\n\\noxidation\\nstate\\n\\nnumber of valence\\nelectrons assigned to the\\n\\natom in the molecule� ���� �–=  (24.1)\\nThe application of these rules to the assignment of oxidation states is best \\n\\nillustrated by example.\\n\\nExAMPLE 24-1: Assign an oxidation state to each atom in the following \\ncompounds:\\n(a) cesium chloride, CsCl (b) manganese heptoxide, Mn2O7\\n(c) hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 (d) potassium superoxide KO2\\n (e) perchloric acid, HClO4\\n\\nSolution: (a) Applying Rule 3, we assign the cesium atom an oxidation \\nstate of +1. Because CsCl is a neutral species, we see from Rule 2 that \\n(+1) + x = 0, where x is the oxidation state of the chlorine atom. Thus, \\nthe chlorine atom in CsCl is assigned an oxidation state of –1.\\n\\n(b) Applying Rule 7, we assign each oxygen atom an oxidation state  \\nof –2. Because Mn2O7 is a neutral species, we see from Rule 2 that \\n2x + 7(–2) = 0, where x  is the oxidation state of the manganese atom. \\nThus, each manganese atom in Mn2O7 is assigned an oxidation state of +7.\\n\\n(c) Applying Rule 6, we assign each hydrogen atom an oxidation  \\nstate of +1. Because H2O2 is a neutral species, we see from Rule 2 that \\n2(+1) + 2x = 0, where x is the oxidation state of each oxygen atom. Thus, \\neach oxygen atom in H2O2 is assigned an oxidation state of –1. Remember \\nthat Rule 6 takes precedence over Rule 7. The –1 oxidation state of each \\noxygen atom in H2O2 is characteristic of peroxides.\\n\\n(d) Applying Rule 3, we assign an oxidation state of +1 to the potas-\\nsium atom. Because KO2 is a neutral species, we have 1 + 2x = 0, where x is \\nthe oxidation state of each oxygen atom. Thus, the oxidation state of each \\noxygen atom in KO2 is \\n\\n1_\\n2– . Keep in mind that Rule 3 takes precedence over \\n\\nRule 7 in this case. The 1_2–  oxidation state of the oxygen atoms in KO2 is \\ncharacteristic of superoxides.\\n\\n(e) Applying Rules 6 and 7, we assign an oxidation state of +1 to the \\nhydrogen atom and –2 to each oxygen atom. Because HClO4 is a neutral \\nspecies, we have +1 + x + 4(–2) = 0, where x is the oxidation state of the \\nchlorine atom. Thus, the chlorine atom is assigned an oxidation state of +7 \\nin HClO4.\\n\\nExample 24-1 involves only neutral compounds whose net charge must be 0. \\nFor ionic species, the sum of the oxidation states of each atom must equal the \\nnet charge on the ion.\\n\\n H C N O F\\n\\n 2.1 2.55 3.04 3.44 3.98\\n\\n  Si P S Cl\\n\\n  1.90 2.19 2.58 3.16\\n\\n   As Se Br\\n\\n   2.18 2.55 2.96\\n\\n     I\\n\\n     2.66\\n\\nTABLE 24.1 Electronegativities \\nof selected elements*\\n\\n* A full table of electronegativity \\nvalues is given in Figure 7.13.\\n\\n\\n\\n24.

The \\nfollowing Example and Practice Problem illustrate the use of Lewis formulas \\nand Rule 8.\\n\\nExAMPLE 24-2: Use Rule 8 to determine the oxidation states of all the \\natoms in the molecules\\n            (a) thionyl chloride, SOCl2 (b) hydrogen cyanide, HCN\\n            (c) nitrosyl chloride, NOCl (d) phosphorous pentachloride, PCl5\\n\\nSolution: (a) We first write the Lewis formula of a SOCl2 molecule:\\n\\n \\nOS\\n\\nCl\\n\\nCl\\n\\nAccording to Table 24.1, both the oxygen atom and the chlorine atoms are \\nmore electronegative than the sulfur atom, and so according to Rule 8b we \\nwrite\\n\\n \\nOS\\n\\nCl\\n\\nCl\\n\\nA neutral sulfur atom has six valence electrons, and the sulfur atom has \\nbeen assigned two valence electrons in the formula. Applying Equation \\n24.1, Rule 8d, we have\\n\\noxidation state of S in SOCl2 = 6 – 2 = +4\\n\\nA neutral chlorine atom has seven valence electrons, and each chlorine \\natom has been assigned eight valence electrons in the formula. Thus,\\n\\noxidation state of Cl in SOCl2 = 7 – 8 = –1\\n\\nA neutral oxygen atom has six valence electrons, and each oxygen atom has \\nbeen assigned eight valence electrons in the formula. Thus,\\n\\noxidation state of O in SOCl2 = 6 – 8 = –2\\n\\n\\n\\n90324-1. OxIdATIOn STATES\\n\\nNotice that the sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms is zero, as it \\nmust be according to Rule 2. Also notice that we determined the oxidation \\nstate of each atom independently using Rule 8 rather than determining two \\nof them and then using Rule 2. In this way, we have a nice check that the \\nsum of the oxidation states is equal to the net charge on the species.\\n\\n(b) We first write the Lewis formula for a HCN molecule,\\n\\n H C N\\n\\nAccording to Table 24.1, a nitrogen atom is more electronegative than a \\ncarbon atom, and a carbon atom is more electronegative than a hydrogen \\natom. Therefore, we write\\n\\n H C N\\n\\nA neutral nitrogen atom has five valence electrons, and the nitrogen atom \\nin the formula has been assigned eight valence electrons.

OxIdATIOn STATES\\n\\nProblems 24-1 through 24-8 at the end of the chapter provide some addi-\\ntional practice in assigning oxidation states.\\n\\nThe previous Example and Practice Problem show how to use Lewis for-\\nmulas to deduce the value of oxidation states. In many cases we can also use \\noxidation states to help write Lewis formulas. This is particularly so for species \\ninvolving transition metals. Although many compounds of transition metals are \\nionic compounds, many others are covalent. To write Lewis formulas of cova-\\nlent compounds or polyatomic ions involving transition metals, we must first \\ndetermine the number of valence electrons. For the main-group elements, the \\nnumber of valence electrons in the free atom is simply determined by its posi-\\ntion in the periodic table. For the transition metals, however, the situation is not \\nso simple. The difficulty involves the inverted order of filling of the two outer-\\nmost occupied orbitals (recall, for example, that the 4s orbital fills before the \\n3d orbital in a neutral first row transition metal atom) as well as the similarity \\nof the energies of these orbitals. We define the number of valence electrons in a \\ntransition metal to be equal to the oxidation state of the transition metal in the \\ncompound being considered. Thus, for example, the titanium atom in a TiF4 \\nmolecule has four valence electron because the oxidation state of titanium in \\nTiF4 is +4 (Rules 2 and 4). We assign a total of 4 + (4 × 7) = 32 valence electrons \\nin TiF4, so its Lewis formula is\\n\\n \\n\\nF Ti\\n\\nF\\n\\nF\\n\\nF\\n\\nWe should point out that this molecule is an AX4 species in the notation of \\nVSEPR theory (Chapter 8) and so is tetrahedral.\\n\\nThe use of oxidation states to write Lewis formulas of species involving tran-\\nsition metals is particularly important for oxyanions such as the manganate, \\nMnO2–4 , and vanadate, VO3\\n\\n–, ions, for example. Let’s consider the manganate ion. \\nUsing Rules 2 and 7, we see that the oxidation state of the manganese atom in a \\nMnO2–4  ion is +6. Therefore, we assign the manganese atom six valence electrons \\nfor a total of 6 + (4 × 6) + 2 = 32 valence electrons in the MnO2–4  ion. The Lewis \\nformula with the least separation of formal charge is\\n\\n \\n\\nO Mn\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\nO\\n\\n–\\n\\n–\\n\\nwith other resonance forms. This ion is an AX4 species in the notation of VSEPR \\ntheory and so is tetrahedral.\\n\\nExAMPLE 24-3: Determine the number of valence electrons for the \\nvanadium atom in the vanadate ion, VO3\\n\\n–, and write its Lewis formula.

OxIdATIOn-REducTIOn REAcTIOnS906\\n\\nSolution: The oxidation state of the vanadium atom in the vanadate ion is \\n+5 (Rules 2 and 7), and so we assign five valence electrons to the vanadium \\natom. Therefore, there is a total of 5 + (3 × 6) + 1 = 24 valence electrons in a \\nVO3\\n\\n– ion.

Oxidation-Reduction Reactions Involve the Transfer  \\nof Electrons from One Reactant to Another\\n\\nElectrons are transferred from one reactant to another in an oxidation-reduc-\\ntion reaction. In fact, oxidation-reduction reactions are often called electron-\\ntransfer reactions. The reactant that gains or accepts electrons is called the \\noxidizing agent, and the reactant that loses or donates electrons is called the re-\\nducing agent. Usually, one particular type of atom in the oxidizing agent ac-\\ncepts the electrons, and hence its oxidation state decreases. Similarly, often one \\nparticular type of atom in the reducing agent donates the electrons, and hence \\nits oxidation state increases. Thus, the oxidizing agent contains atoms that are \\nreduced, and the reducing agent contains atoms that are oxidized. Table 24.2 \\nsummarizes these results.\\n\\nConsider the reaction described by the equation\\n\\nFe2O3(s) + 3 CO(g) → 2 Fe(s) + 3 CO2(g)\\n\\n\\n\\n90724-2. OxIdATIOn-REducTIOn REAcTIOnS\\n\\nThe oxidation state of each iron atom decreases from +3 in Fe2O3(s) to 0 in \\nFe(s), and the oxidation state of each carbon atom increases from +2 in CO(g) \\nto +4 in CO2(g). Therefore, Fe2O3(s) is the oxidizing agent because it contains \\nthe atoms that are reduced, and CO(g) is the reducing agent because it con-\\ntains the atoms that are oxidized.\\n\\nExAMPLE 24-4: In the following chemical equation, identify the atom \\nthat is oxidized, the atom that is reduced, the oxidizing agent, and the \\nreducing agent:\\n\\nMnO2(s) + 4 HCl(aq) → MnCl2(aq) + Cl2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\\n\\nSolution: The oxidation state of the manganese atom is +4 in MnO2(s) and \\n+2 in MnCl2(s). The oxidation state of the chlorine atom is –1 in HCl(aq) \\nand 0 in Cl2(g). Therefore, the chlorine atom is oxidized and the manga-\\nnese atom is reduced in this reaction. Because MnO2(s) contains the atom \\nthat is reduced, it is the oxidizing agent. Because the HCl(aq) contains the \\natom that is oxidized, it is the reducing agent. Notice that two electrons are \\ntransferred in this reaction: one manganese atom accepts two electrons and \\neach of the two chlorine atoms donates one electron. This reaction is used \\non a laboratory scale to prepare chlorine gas for use in chemical reactions.\\n\\nPRAcTIcE PROBLEM 24-4: In the following chemical equation, identify \\nthe reducing agent, the oxidizing agent, the species reduced, and the spe-\\ncies oxidized:\\n\\nO2(aq) + 6 I–(aq) + 2 H2O(l) → 2 I3\\n–(aq) + 4 OH–(aq)\\n\\nAnswer: O2(aq) is the oxidizing agent and the species that is reduced; I–(aq) \\nis the reducing agent and the species that is oxidized.\\n\\nThe reducing agent:\\n\\nis the electron donor\\n\\ncontains the atom that is oxidized\\n\\ncontains the atom whose oxidation state increases\\n\\nThe oxidizing agent:\\n\\nis the electron acceptor\\n\\ncontains the atom that is reduced\\n\\ncontains the atom whose oxidation state decreases\\n\\nTABLE 24.2 Summary of oxidation-reduction reactions\\n\\nAn agent is something that performs \\na task.

Electron-Transfer Reactions can Be Separated  \\ninto Two Half Reactions\\n\\nThe electron-transfer reaction described by the equation\\n\\nZn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s) (24.2)\\n\\ncan be separated into two half reaction equations, one representing the oxida-\\ntion process and the other representing the reduction process:\\n\\n Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2 e–            (oxidation)  (24.3)\\n\\n Cu2+(aq) + 2 e– → Cu(s)            (reduction) (24.4)\\n\\nIf we add Equations 24.3 and 24.4, then we obtain Equation 24.2. The half re-\\naction equation in which electrons appear on the right side (Equation 24.3) is \\ncalled the oxidation half reaction (recall that oxidation is a loss  of electrons). \\nThe half reaction equation in which electrons appear on the left side (Equation \\n24.4) is called the reduction half reaction (recall that reduction is a gain  of \\nelectrons). The oxidation half reaction supplies electrons to the reduction half \\nreaction (Table 24.2).\\n\\nExAMPLE 24-5: Write the oxidation and reduction half reactions for the \\nreaction described by the equation\\n\\nTl+(aq) + 2 Ce4+(aq) → 2 Ce3+(aq) + Tl3+(aq)\\n\\nThis reaction is used in analytical chemistry for determining the concentra-\\ntion of thallium(I).\\n\\nSolution: The oxidation state of the thallium atom increases from +1 in Tl+ \\nto +3 in Tl3+ and so it is oxidized. The oxidation state of the cerium atom \\ndecreases from +4 in Ce4+ to +3 in Ce3+ and so it is reduced.\\n\\nWe identify the two half reactions by writing the equations for the oxi-\\ndation and the reduction reactions separately:\\n\\nTl+(aq) → Tl3+(aq) + 2 e–            (oxidation)\\n\\nCe4+(aq) + e– → Ce3+(aq)            (reduction)\\n\\nBecause the Tl+ ion is a two-electron reducing agent, whereas the Ce4+ ion \\nis a one-electron oxidizing agent, two moles of Ce4+ are required to oxidize \\none mole of Tl+. Thus, the complete balanced equation is obtained by mul-\\ntiplying the cerium half reaction equation by two and adding the result to \\nthe thallium half reaction equation:\\n\\nFigure 24.3   (a) The oxidation-\\nreduction reaction between the  \\npurple-black oxidizing agent  \\nKMnO4(s) and a few drops of \\nglycerin, HOCH2(CHOH)CH2OH(l), \\nis very vigorous, as shown in (b).  \\nThe primary reaction products are \\nMnO2(s), CO2(g), H2O(g), and K2O(s). \\nOrganic compounds should not be \\nbrought into contact with strong \\noxidizing agents, except under care- \\nfully controlled conditions—otherwise, \\nserious injury could result.\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n(b)\\n\\n\\n\\n90924-4.

Equations for Oxidation-Reduction Reactions can Be \\nBalanced by Balancing Each Half Reaction Separately\\n\\nConsider the equation for the reaction between iron and aqueous chlorine \\n(Figure 24.4):\\n\\nFe(s) + Cl2(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + Cl–(aq)            (not balanced)\\n\\nThis equation as it stands is not balanced. If we write\\n\\nFe(s) + Cl2(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 2 Cl–(aq)            (not balanced)\\n\\nthen the equation is balanced with respect to the elements but not  with respect \\nto charge. The net charge on the left side is zero, whereas the net charge on the \\nright side is (+3) + 2(–1) = +1. The balanced equation,\\n\\n2 Fe(s) + 3 Cl2(aq) → 2 Fe3+(aq) + 6 Cl–(aq)\\n\\nhas the same number of atoms of each type on both sides and  the same net \\ncharge (zero in this case) on both sides.\\n\\nAlthough fairly simple oxidation-reduction reaction equations such as \\nthis one can be balanced by inspection, attempting to balance more complex \\n oxidation-reduction reaction equations by guessing the balancing coefficients \\ncan be time consuming and frustrating. Therefore, we shall now develop a more \\ngeneral method of balancing oxidation-reduction reactions: the method of \\nhalf reactions. This method can be used to balance even the most complicated \\nreaction equation in a straightforward and systematic way. We first apply the \\nmethod of half reactions to equations for reactions that take place in acidic \\nsolution, and then we discuss its application to equations for reactions that take \\nplace in basic solution.\\n\\nFigure 24.4  Chlorine in aqueous \\nsolution oxidizes iron metal to Fe3+(aq), \\nwhich is orange in the presence of \\nCl–(aq) as a result of the formation of \\nthe orange complex ion [FeCl]2+(aq). \\n(a) Before addition of iron powder \\nto Cl2(aq).

The net result is an increase in the number of hydrogen \\natoms on the side of the equation to which the H2O molecules are added. By \\nadding H2O molecules and OH– ions to opposite sides of the equation in pairs, \\nwe are able to maintain the oxygen atom balance that we established in step 3. \\nThus, step 4 for balancing oxidation-reduction reaction equations in basic solu-\\ntions is as follows:\\n\\n 4.  Balance each half reaction equation with respect to hydrogen atoms by adding a \\nnumber of H2O molecules equal to the number of excess hydrogen atoms to the side \\ndeficient in hydrogen atoms and an equal number of OH– ions to the side opposite to \\nthe added H2O molecules.\\n\\nThe procedure outlined above is best illustrated by example.

To \\nbalance the equation with respect to oxygen atoms we add one H2O molecule \\nto the right side of the equation (step 3) to obtain:\\n\\n ClO– → Cl– + H2O\\n\\nThe right side of this equation now has two extra hydrogen atoms. To bal-\\nance the equation with respect to hydrogen atoms, we add two H2O molecules \\nto the left side and two OH– ions to the right side (step 4).\\n\\n2 H2O + ClO– → Cl– + H2O + 2 OH–\\n\\nCanceling the H2O molecule on the right side with one from the left side, we \\nnow balance the equation with respect to charge by adding 2e– to the left side \\nto obtain:\\n\\nH2O + ClO– + 2 e– → Cl– + 2 OH–\\n\\nThe balanced equation for the half reaction with phases indicated is\\n\\nH2O(l) + ClO–(aq) + 2 e– → Cl–(aq) + 2 OH–(aq)\\n\\nFinally, in cases involving metal hydroxides in basic solution, we add OH– \\nions directly, skipping steps 3 and 4. This is illustrated in balancing the follow-\\ning half reaction equation:\\n\\nCu(OH)2(s) → Cu(s)\\n\\nCu(OH)2(s) → Cu(s) + 2 OH–(aq)\\n\\nCu(OH)2(s) +\\t2 e– → Cu(s) + 2 OH–(aq)\\n\\n\\n\\n24.

Billions of dollars Are Spent Each year to Protect Metals \\nfrom corrosion\\n\\nWe are all familiar with corrosion, the best-known example of which is the rust-\\ning of iron and steel.

There are \\na wide variety of iron oxides in addition to Fe2O3(s), some of which include \\nFe3O4(s) (black rust), Fe(OH)2(s) (green rust), and FeO(s) (a black powder). \\nIn addition, many of these oxides can form various hydrides—giving rise to a \\ndiverse range of colors and chemistry (Figures 24.8 and 24.9).\\n\\nMost metals when exposed to air develop an oxide film. In some cases this \\nfilm is very thin and protects the metal, helping to maintain its luster. Examples \\nare nickel and chromium. However, depending on the metal, the humidity, \\nthe acidity, and the presence of certain anions, corrosion can completely de-\\nstroy a metal. For example, the Cl–(aq) anion, which is present in sea spray and \\non roads treated with rock salt, promotes corrosion through the formation of \\nchloro complexes. Other anions act by increasing the electrical conductivity of \\nthe solution causing the corrosion.

He received little formal education and at age 14 was apprenticed to a \\nbookbinder and bookseller. He educated himself by reading books from his \\nworkplace, which led to his interest in science. In 1812, he began attending public \\nlectures on various scientific topics by Humphry Davy, a prominent chemist. He \\npresented a 300-page book that he had written based on the lectures to Davy, \\nwho was so impressed that he soon appointed Faraday as his assistant at the \\nRoyal Institution. Davy seems to have become increasingly jealous of Faraday’s \\nsuccessful experiments and had him work on a long series of useless experiments. \\nUpon Davy’s death in 1829, Faraday was able to return to his early successful work \\non electricity and magnetism. He received a lifetime appointment at the Royal \\nInstitution as the Fullerian Professor of Chemistry. His most important work in \\nchemistry are his laws of electrolysis, but his greatest work was in the physics of \\nelectricity and magnetism. He is considered one of the greatest experimentalists \\nof all time.\\n\\nFaraday was a lay preacher in the obscure Sandemanian sect, an offshoot of \\nthe Scottish Presbyterian Church, and met his wife through the sect. He was a very \\nreligious man, and due to his religious beliefs, he refused knighthood and the \\npresidency of the Royal Society. He preferred burial in a Sandemanian plot and \\nrefused burial at Westminster Abbey. He was a hugely popular lecturer on science \\nand gave an annual Christmas reading for children of his book The Chemical \\nHistory of a Candle. He received many honors during his life, and in the 1990s \\nhis picture was on the British 20-pound banknote, a rare honor for a scientist.\\n\\nAs a result of his being self-taught and not having had a formal education, \\nFaraday was not well trained in mathematics, something that he regretted his \\nentire life. In spite of his receiving countless honors and awards and enjoying \\ninternational fame as an experimentalist, he said in his later life, “If I could live \\nmy life over again, I would study mathematics; it is a great mistake not to do so, \\nbut it is too late now.”\\n\\n\\n\\n931\\n\\n25.

Electrochemical principles explain the operation of the batteries that power our cell phones and hand-\\nheld calculators. They allow physicians to guide the rhythm of a heartbeat and \\nenable our brains and senses to function. Chemists rely on electrochemical sen-\\nsors to measure pH, to perform potentiometric titrations, and to monitor a \\nwide variety of ionic species and enzymes, even in the presence of numerous \\nother species. Electrochemistry is also used to combat corrosion and to produce \\nmany important industrial chemicals through electrolysis.\\n\\nIn Chapter 23 we used the Gibbs energy to predict whether a reaction is \\nspontaneous. We showed that if the Gibbs energy change is greater than zero, \\nthen energy must be supplied to drive the reaction. For an oxidation-reduc-\\ntion reaction, that energy can be provided by an electric current. Conversely, \\nwhen an oxidation-reduction reaction is spontaneous, we can use it to obtain \\nelectricity directly from chemicals, without the need for heat engines driven \\nby combustion reactions. These two processes are the subject of this chapter \\non electrochemistry.\\n\\nIn this chapter we show how to calculate the current needed to produce a \\ngiven amount of reaction product. We also show how to predict the voltage pro-\\nduced in an electrochemical reaction and the work that can be obtained. We \\nshall apply these results to a variety of commercial processes.\\n\\n25-1.  Chemical Reactions Can Occur as a Result of the Passage of \\nan Electric Current Through a Solution\\n\\nThe science of electrochemistry began at the end of the 18th century when \\nLuigi Galvani, an Italian scientist, showed that the contraction of a frog’s leg \\nproduces an electric current. While other scientists of that time were invok-\\ning mysterious forces to explain Galvani’s “animal electricity,” his countryman, \\nAlessandro Volta, was using experiments to show that the phenomenon could \\nbe explained in purely physical and chemical terms. Volta constructed a device \\n\\n\\n\\n25. ElECTROChEMiSTRy932\\n\\nthat produced an electric current of considerable power. In this voltaic pile \\n(Figure 25.1), alternate disks of dissimilar metals, such as zinc and copper, are \\nseparated by damp cloths soaked in salt water. The electric current is produced \\nby a chemical reaction between the substances in the pile. The reaction occurs \\nwhen an electrical connection is made between the top and the bottom of the \\npile. The voltage developed by a voltaic pile depends on the number and nature \\nof the pair of metal disks used to construct the pile.\\n\\nTo study the chemical reaction in a voltaic pile, we need a measure of how \\nstrongly the electric current that is produced is driven through the wire con-\\nnecting the top and bottom of the pile. Voltage, named after Volta, is this \\ndriving force. Voltage plays a role in electrical systems analogous to force in \\nmechanical systems. The SI unit of voltage is the volt, also named in honor of \\nVolta, and denoted by V.\\n\\nIn mechanical systems, energy is equal to force times distance. In electrical \\nsystems, the electrical energy, U, is equal to the voltage, V, times charge, Z :\\n\\nU = VZ (25.1)\\n\\nRecall that the SI unit of electrical charge is the coulomb, C. In terms of SI \\nunits, we see from Equation 25.1 that\\n\\n1 joule = 1 volt × 1 coulomb\\n\\nor that one volt is equivalent to one joule per coulomb or 1 V = 1 J∙C−1.\\nElectric currents are measured in amperes, A. One ampere is the flow of \\n\\none coulomb, C, of charge per second, or 1 A = 1 C∙s−1.\\nThe total charge that flows in a given time is equal to the current times the \\n\\ntime. Representing charge (in coulombs) by Z, current (in amperes) by I, and \\ntime (in seconds) by t, we have\\n\\nZ  = It (25.2)\\n\\nUsing SI units, we have coulombs = amperes × seconds or 1 C = 1 A∙s.\\n\\n \\n\\nFigure 25.1 Diagram of Volta’s \\napparatus for the generation of an \\nelectric current from a chemical \\nreaction.

Using \\na voltaic pile of over 250 plates, one of the most powerful then available, Davy \\npassed an electric current through the molten salts of sodium chloride and \\npotassium chloride and was able to isolate pure sodium and potassium metals. \\nHe then went on to isolate barium, magnesium, calcium, and strontium by simi-\\nlar methods. The highly reactive nature of these metals provided chemists with \\nmany new reactions to explore.\\n\\n25-2.  an Electrochemical Cell Produces Electricity directly from a \\nChemical Reaction\\n\\nIn this section we consider the use of a spontaneous chemical reaction \\n(DGrxn < 0) to produce an electric current. The voltaic pile was the first example \\nof such a device. Recall from Chapter 24 that electrons are transferred from \\none substance to another in oxidation-reduction (electron-transfer) reactions. \\nFigure 25.5 shows that when a zinc rod is immersed in an aqueous solution \\nof copper sulfate, the oxidation-reduction reaction described by the following \\nequation occurs spontaneously:\\n\\nZn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq)\\n\\nIt is possible to use oxidation-reduction reactions to produce an electric cur-\\nrent. The basic idea is to keep the reactants [Zn(s) and Cu2+(aq) in the equation \\nabove] and the products [Cu(s) and Zn2+(aq)] separated physically in such a \\nway that the electrons are transferred from the reducing agent to the oxidizing \\nagent after passing through an external circuit.

Such cells provided the power for the telegraph system in \\nthe United States for decades. This cell consists of two different metals, Zn(s) \\nand Cu(s), each immersed in an electrolyte solution containing their respective \\nmetal ions, Zn2+(aq) and Cu2+(aq). The zinc and copper metals also act as the \\ncell’s electrodes. In general, an electrode is any solid on the surface of which \\noxidation-reduction reactions occur. The two solutions in the cell are connected \\nelectrically through a salt bridge that consists of a saturated KCl(aq) solution \\nmixed with agar (a substance that forms a gel similar to gelatin). The purpose \\nof the gel is to hold the salt solution in the tube, thus preventing the solutions \\nfrom mixing while permitting the passage of current carried by ions.

The electrodes are attached to metal leads (wires) that \\nenable the cell to deliver electric current to the external circuit. \\n\\nLet’s see how an electrochemical cell produces electricity directly from a \\nchemical reaction. The voltage produced by the cell can be measured using a \\nvoltmeter, as shown in Figure 25.6. The current through the metal sections of \\nan electrochemical cell like that shown in Figure 25.6 is carried by electrons, \\nbut electrons do not pass through aqueous phases. The current through the \\nsolution is carried by cations and anions moving in opposite directions toward \\nthe two metal electrodes. The electrode at which the reduction half reaction \\noccurs is called the cathode; the electrode at which the oxidation half reac-\\ntion occurs is called the anode. These definitions are remembered conveniently \\nwith the aid of the following mnemonic:\\n\\ncathode\\nreduction\\n\\nconsonants � anodeoxidationvowels �\\nWhen current flows through an electrochemical cell, the cations in the solution \\nmove toward the cathode and the anions in the solution move toward the anode:\\n\\ncat ions → cathode  anions → anode\\n\\nWhen the cell shown in Figure 25.6 is used as a source of electricity, the reac-\\ntions that occur at the electrodes are given by\\n\\nZn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2 e−  (oxidation of Zn at anode)\\n\\nCu2+(aq) + 2 e− → Cu(s)  (reduction of Cu2+ at cathode)\\n\\nThe zinc-copper cell is based on the coupling of two half reactions. When \\nthe external circuit is completed by an electrical connection between the Zn(s) \\nand Cu(s) electrodes, electrons can flow in the external circuit, that is, through \\nthe wire leads and the voltmeter (Figure 25.6). The electrons produced at the \\nzinc electrode by the oxidation of Zn(s) travel through the external circuit to \\nthe Cu(s) electrode, where they are consumed in the reduction of Cu2+(aq) to \\nCu(s). The fact that zinc metal is a much stronger reducing agent (electron \\ndonor) than copper metal is what drives the electron flow from the zinc to the \\ncopper in the external circuit.\\n\\nAs noted earlier, the current in the electrolyte solutions and in the salt bridge \\nis carried by ions and not by electrons. Because Zn2+(aq) ions are produced in \\nthe solution containing the Zn(s) electrode, negative ions must enter the \\nZnSO4(aq) solution from the salt bridge in order to maintain electrical neutral-\\nity in the solution. Because Cu2+(aq) ions are removed from the solution \\ncon taining the Cu(s) electrode, positive ions must enter the CuSO4(aq) solution \\nfrom the salt bridge in order to maintain electrical neutrality in that solution. In \\nthis case, the KCl(aq) in the salt bridge provides both these negative and positive \\nions to the respective solutions. By providing an equal number of Cl–(aq) anions \\nand K+(aq) cations, the electrical neutrality of the salt bridge is also maintained. \\nThus, the current through the cell solutions is carried by moving ions, with \\nanions moving toward the anode (zinc electrode) and cations moving toward \\nthe cathode (copper electrode). Oxidation occurs at the anode by the oxidation \\nof Zn(s) to Zn2+(aq) and electrons. The electrons produced enter the external \\ncircuit from this electrode, making the zinc electrode negative. Because reduc- \\n\\n\\n\\n25-2.  an ElECTROChEMiCal CEll PROduCES ElECTRiCiTy FROM a ChEMiCal REaCTiOn 937\\n\\ntion occurs at the cathode, electrons that arrive from the external circuit at the \\ncopper electrode are consumed in the reduction of Cu2+(aq) to Cu(s), making \\nthe copper electrode positive. The total current through the cell electrolyte, \\nwhich must equal the current in the external circuit, is carried by anions moving \\ntoward the zinc electrode, where Zn2+(aq) ions are produced, and by cations \\nmoving toward the copper electrode, where Cu2+(aq) ions are consumed.\\n\\nThe components of an electrochemical cell must be set up in such a manner \\nthat the transfer of electrons from the reducing agent to the oxidizing agent pro-\\nceeds via the external circuit. If the two electrolyte solutions were simply mixed \\ntogether, the cell would not produce a current because, as shown in Figure 25.5, \\nCu2+(aq) would be spontaneously deposited as copper metal on the zinc elec-\\ntrode. In other words, the cell would be internally short-circuited. For this rea-\\nson, the reducing agent, Zn(s), must be separated physically from the oxidizing \\nagent, Cu2+(aq); the separation is achieved in this case with a salt bridge.\\n\\nEXaMPlE 25-2: Consider the electrochemical cell shown in Figure 25.7. \\nIndicate the current flow in the external circuit and in the cell electrolyte \\nsolutions.\\n\\nSolution: From the figure we see that the Pb(s) electrode is the negative \\nelectrode and the Ag(s) electrode is the positive electrode.

For each \\nPb2+(aq) ion produced, two NO3−(aq) ions flow from the salt bridge into \\nthe Pb(NO3)2(aq) solution to maintain electrical neutrality. Two positive \\nAg+(aq) ions are consumed at the silver electrode for each Pb2+(aq) ion pro-\\nduced; thus, two K+(aq) ions flow simultaneously from the salt bridge into \\nthe AgNO3(aq) solution. This flow of ions maintains electrical neutrality \\nboth in the two cell solutions and in the salt bridge solution. The net ionic \\nequation that describes the overall cell reaction is\\n\\nPb(s) + 2 Ag+(aq) → Pb2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s)\\n\\nIf we simply place a lead rod in AgNO3(aq), then the spontaneous reduction \\nof Ag+(aq) by Pb(s) occurs directly on the surface of the lead, where silver \\nmetal crystals form.

For example, the cell diagram for the \\ncell shown in Figure 25.6 is\\n\\nZn(s)|ZnSO4(aq)||CuSO4(aq)|Cu(s)\\n\\nThe single vertical bars in the cell diagram indicate boundaries of phases that \\nare in contact, and the double vertical bars indicate a salt bridge. Thus, in the \\ncell represented by this diagram, Zn(s) and ZnSO4(aq) are separate phases in \\nphysical contact, as are CuSO4(aq) and Cu(s), and a salt bridge separates the \\nZnSO4(aq) and CuSO4(aq) solutions. By convention, we write the metal elec-\\ntrodes at the ends of the diagram, insoluble substances and/or gases adjacent \\nto the metals, and soluble species near the middle of the diagram.\\n\\nThe basic convention for obtaining the complete equation for a cell reac-\\ntion from the cell diagram is to write the equation for the half reaction of the \\nleft-hand electrode in the cell diagram as an oxidation half-reaction equation \\nand the equation for the half reaction of the right-hand electrode in the cell \\ndiagram as a reduction half-reaction equation.

This example \\nalso illustrates how we deal with cell reactions that involve a gas. We first note \\nthat Zn(s) is oxidized to Zn2+(aq); thus, the equation for the oxidation half reac-\\ntion of the cell is\\n\\nZn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2 e−  (oxidation, left-hand electrode)\\n\\nWe next note that H+(aq) is reduced to hydrogen gas; thus, the equation for the \\nreduction half reaction of the cell is\\n\\n2 H+(aq) + 2 e− → H2(g)  (reduction, right-hand electrode)\\n\\nThis reduction half reaction requires a nonreactive metal electrode that can \\nprovide a pathway for the electrons coming through the external circuit from \\nthe zinc electrode to enter the cell compartment containing the H+(aq) solu-\\ntion. The reduction of the H+(aq) to H2(g) takes place on the surface of this \\nmetal electrode, which acts as a source of electrons. In this case, the necessary \\nnonreactive electrode is provided by inserting a platinum coil or strip into the \\ncell compartment containing H+(aq) and H2(g). Platinum is a relatively unreac-\\ntive metal that simply provides a metallic surface on which the reduction half \\nreaction occurs. Other relatively unreactive metals commonly used as elec-\\ntrodes are gold and carbon (graphite). An electrode involving a gaseous species \\nand nonreactive metal is called a gas electrode.

The nernst Equation Can be used to determine the Cell \\nVoltage for a Stated Reaction\\n\\nWalther Nernst (Figure 25.10), who received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1920, \\nperformed pioneering work in electrochemistry, investigating how the cell volt-\\nage depends on the concentration of the electrolytes, the size of the electrodes, \\nand other factors. He found, for example, that the voltage of the cell,\\n\\nZn(s)|ZnSO4(aq)||CuSO4(aq)|Cu(s)\\n\\nis independent of the size of the cell, the size of the electrodes, and the vol-\\nume of the ZnSO4(aq) and CuSO4(aq) solutions. He also found that the volt-\\nage of the cell increases when the concentration of Cu2+(aq) is increased and \\ndecreases when the concentration of Zn2+(aq) is increased. The effect of a \\nchange in reactant or product concentration on cell voltage is easily under-\\nstood in qualitative terms by applying Le Châtelier’s principle to the cell reac-\\ntion, given that the voltage of the cell is a measure of the driving force of the \\ncell reaction.\\n\\nThe reaction of the zinc-copper cell (Figure 25.6) can be described by the \\nequilibrium equation\\n\\nZn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ⇌ Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq)\\n\\nAn increase in the value of [Cu2+] increases the driving force of the reaction \\nfrom left to right, thereby increasing the cell voltage; whereas an increase in \\nthe value of [Zn2+] increases the driving force of the reaction from right to left, \\nthereby decreasing the cell voltage.\\n\\nEXaMPlE 25-4: Consider an electrochemical cell in which the cell reac-\\ntion described by the equation\\n\\nH2(g) + 2 AgCl(s) ⇌ 2 Ag(s) + 2 H+(aq) + 2 Cl−(aq)\\n\\ntakes place.

If the voltage difference is due to a chemical reaction \\nthat constitutes an electrochemical cell operating at a constant temperature \\nand pressure, then the voltage difference is called the electromotive force \\n(emf) of the cell, which we denote by Ecell. The corresponding energy change is \\nequivalent to the Gibbs energy change of the reaction. Therefore, we can write \\nEquation 25.1 in the notation\\n\\n DGrxn = Z Ecell (25.3)\\n\\nEquation 25.3 is essentially Equation 25.1 written in a notation appropri-\\nate for the study of electrochemical cells. In this equation, Z  represents the \\ncharge transferred in the cell reaction as written. For example, consider the \\nCd(s)|CdSO4(aq)|Hg2SO4(s)|Hg(l ) cell presented in Example 25-3. The \\noxidation-reduction equation describing the cell reaction is\\n\\n Cd(s) + Hg2SO4(s) → 2 Hg(l ) + Cd2+(aq) + SO42−(aq) (25.4)\\n\\nand the two half reactions are\\n\\nCd(s) → Cd2+(aq) + 2 e− (oxidation)\\n\\nHg2SO4(s) + 2 e− → 2 Hg(l ) + SO42−(aq) (reduction)\\n\\nThus, when one mole of this reaction takes place, two moles of electrons are \\ntransferred and the quantity Z  in Equation 25.3 is equal to the charge trans-\\nferred by two moles of electrons. Because we will be dealing with the charges \\ntransferred by a number of moles of electrons, it is convenient to introduce a \\nquantity called Faraday’s constant. Faraday’s constant, which is named after \\nthe English scientist Michael Faraday (Frontispiece), is defined as the charge \\non one mole (Avogadro’s number) of protons. Thus, the value of Faraday’s con-\\nstant, which we denote by F, is equal to\\n\\nF   = (charge on a proton)(Avogadro’s number)\\n\\n= (1.60218 × 10–19 C)(6.02214 × 1023 mol –1) = 96 485 C∙mol –1\\n\\nBecause electrons are negatively charged, the charge transferred when \\none mole of the reaction described by Equation 25.4 takes place is –2F  = \\n–192 970 C∙mol–1, where the unit mol–1 here refers to one mole of the reaction \\n\\nStrictly speaking, the terms voltage \\nand electromotive force are not \\nsynonomous. The electromotive force \\nof a cell is the measured voltage when \\nthe current drawn from the cell is \\nextremely small (essentially zero).\\n\\n\\n\\n25-4.

We can generalize this result to any oxidation-reduction \\nreaction that constitutes an electrochemical cell by writing Z as –neF, where \\nne is the (unitless) stoichiometric coefficient of the electrons in the two half \\nreaction equations that make up the overall reaction equation. Using this nota-\\ntion, Equation 25.3 becomes\\n\\n DGrxn = –neF Ecell (25.5)\\n\\nThe units of DGrxn are joules per mole ( J∙mol–1) and the units on the right side \\nof Equation 25.5 are (C∙mol–1)(V) = C∙V∙mol–1 = J∙mol–1, as they must be.\\n\\nIn Chapter 23 we found that DGrxn is related to the value of Q/K, the ratio \\nof the thermodynamic reaction quotient to the thermodynamic equilibrium \\nconstant, by Equation 23.22,\\n\\nQ\\n—\\nK� �∆Grxn = RT  ln\\n\\nRecall that the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and the thermodynamic \\nreaction quotient are unitless quantities; K  = Kc/Q°c and Q  = Q c/Q°c, where Q°c \\nis what we called the standard reaction quotient in Section 23-8, its numerical \\nvalue is unity, and its units cancel those of both Kc and Q c.\\n\\nCombining the above equation with Equation 25.5 gives us\\n\\nQ\\n—\\nK� �–νeFEcell = RT  ln\\n\\nSolving this equation for Ecell, we obtain\\n\\n \\nQ\\n—\\nK\\n\\nRT\\n—\\nνe F �� ��lnEcell = –  (25.6)\\n\\nEquation 25.6 is called the Nernst equation. The Nernst equation tells us how \\nthe cell voltage depends on the concentrations of the products and the reac-\\ntants via the thermodynamic reaction quotient, Q , the thermodynamic equilib-\\nrium constant, K, and the kelvin temperature, T. As we have seen, the value of \\nne is that of the (unitless) stoichiometric coefficient of the number of electrons \\nin the two half-reaction equations for the cell.\\n\\nWe often apply the Nernst equation at 25.0°C. Evaluating RT/F at 25.0°C, \\nwe have\\n\\nRT\\n—\\nF\\n\\n(8.3145 J·mol–1·K–1)(298.2 K)\\n—\\n\\n96 485 C·mol–1\\n= = 0.02570 J·C–1 = 0.02570 V\\n\\nThus, at 25.0°C the Nernst equation (Equation 25.6) becomes\\n\\n \\nQ\\n—\\nK\\n\\n0.02570 V\\n—\\n\\nνe � �ln (at 25.0°C)Ecell = –  (25.7)\\nRecall from Chapter 19 that, if Q/K < 1, then the reaction is spontaneous from \\nleft to right as written. In this case, ln(Q/K) is negative because it is the loga-\\n\\n\\n\\n25. ElECTROChEMiSTRy944\\n\\nrithm of a number less than 1. Thus, if Q/K < 1, then Equation 25.7 shows that \\nthe cell voltage is positive and, from Equation 25.5, DGrxn is negative. The other \\npossible values of Q/K, the corresponding voltages, and DGrxn values can be \\nanalyzed in the same way. We conclude that the sign of the cell voltage tells us \\nthe direction in which the cell reaction as written is spontaneous. A summary of \\nthe results for the various possibilities is given in Table 25.2.\\n\\nThe value of the cell voltage is a quantitative measure of the driving force \\nof the cell reaction toward equilibrium. The larger the voltage, the greater is \\nthe reaction driving force. If the reaction is at chemical equilibrium, then the \\ncorresponding cell voltage is zero, and there is no driving force for the reaction; \\nthe cell is completely discharged.\\n\\nEquation 25.6 can be written in a form that is often more convenient for \\ncalculations.

E°red Values Can be assigned to half-Reaction Equations\\nIt is not possible to measure the voltage of a single electrode; only the differ-\\nence in voltage between two electrodes can be measured. However, if we agree \\nto choose a numerical value for the standard voltage of a particular electrode, \\nthen we can assign voltages to half-reaction equations.\\n\\nIn this section, we see how the voltages assigned to half reactions are used \\nto calculate values of E°cell for complete cell-reaction equations. Our convention \\nis to set the voltage of the standard hydrogen electrode (abbreviated SHE) that \\nconsists of a nonreactive metal (such as platinum) in a one-molar H+(aq) solu-\\ntion through which hydrogen gas is bubbled at a pressure of one bar equal to \\nzero. That is, we assign the value E° = 0 V (at all temperatures) to the electrode \\nhalf reaction\\n\\n 2 H+(aq, 1 M) + 2 e− → H2(g, 1 bar)  E°red = 0 V  (by convention) (25.14)\\n\\n\\n\\n947\\n\\nEquation 25.14 assigns a standard reduction voltage, denoted E°red, to a half \\nreaction written as a reduction reaction, that is, written with electrons on the \\nleft. A complete cell involves two half reactions: a reduction half reaction, with \\na standard reduction voltage, E°red, and an oxidation half reaction, with a stan-\\ndard oxidation voltage, E°ox. The voltage of a complete cell, which involves a \\nreduction half reaction and an oxidation half reaction, is\\n\\n E°cell = E°red + E°ox (25.15)\\n\\nEquation 25.15 is used together with Equation 25.14 to set up a table of stan-\\ndard reduction voltages. Because, for a particular half reaction, oxidation is the \\nreverse of reduction, we have\\n\\n E°ox = – E°red  (same half reaction) (25.16)\\n\\nThus, given that for the reduction half-reaction equation\\n\\nCu2+(aq, 1 M) + 2 e− → Cu(s)   E°red = +0.34 V\\n\\nwe have for the corresponding oxidation half-reaction equation\\n\\nCu(s) → Cu2+(aq, 1 M) + 2 e−   E°ox = –0.34 V\\n\\nNote that if we double the coefficients in, say, the reduction half-reaction \\nequation,\\n\\n2 Cu2+(aq, 1 M) + 4 e− → 2 Cu(s)  E°red = +0.34 V\\n\\nthe value of E°red is unchanged because the voltage difference (or height of the \\nhill in our analogy from the sidebox in Section 25-1) remains the same. Recall \\nthat current, not voltage, increases with cell size (see Practice Problem 25-4). \\nMoreover, because E°cell is a physically measurable quantity, the magnitude of \\nE°cell, and consequentially E°red for a half-reaction equation, cannot depend on \\nhow we (arbitrarily) choose to write the equations that describe a cell.\\n\\nTo see how standard reduction voltages are obtained, consider the cell in \\nFigure 25.8:\\n\\nZn(s)|ZnCl2(aq)||HCl(aq)|H2(g)|Pt(s)\\n\\nThe experimental value for the standard cell voltage at 25.0°C is\\n\\nE°cell = E°red + E°ox = 0.76 V\\n\\nThe right-hand electrode (cathode) involves the pair H+|H2, and the left-hand \\nelectrode (anode) involves the pair Zn|Zn2+. Thus,\\n\\n E°cell = E°red[H+|H2] + E°ox[Zn|Zn2+] = 0.76 V (25.17)\\n\\nwhere the brackets enclose the oxidized and reduced species for each elec-\\ntrode.

Therefore, the more positive the value \\nof E°red for a half reaction, the stronger is the oxidizing agent (electron acceptor) \\nin the half reaction. The more negative the value of E°red for a half reaction, the \\nstronger is the reducing agent (electron donor) in the half reaction. Thus, fluo-\\nrine is the strongest oxidizing agent (most positive value of E°red) and lithium is \\nthe strongest reducing agent (most negative value of E°red) in Table 25.3. The \\narrangement of half reactions in order of the standard reduction voltages is the \\nbasis for the activity series of metals given in Section 10-7. Compare the order of \\nthe metals listed in Table 10.8 to those in Table 25.3 (some of the metals listed in \\nTable 10.8 are not given in Table 25.3, but may be found in Appendix G). \\n\\nLooking at Table 25.3 we see that platinum is a weaker reducing agent than \\nany of the other metals listed in the table. Thus, platinum metal is not easily \\noxidized and so is less active than most metals. This and its high electrical con-\\nductivity is why platinum makes an excellent nonreactive metal electrode.\\n\\nWe can also use Table 25.3 to see why some metals react with acids to pro-\\nduce H2(g) and others do not under standard conditions at 25.0°C. Let’s con-\\nsider the reaction of Zn(s) with HCl(aq), which we know occurs readily. The \\nequation for the reaction is\\n\\nZn(s) + 2 HCl(aq) → H2(g) + ZnCl2(aq)\\n\\nand the equations for the two half reactions are\\n\\nZn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2 e−  (oxidation)\\nand\\n\\n2 H+(aq) + 2 e– → H2(g) (reduction)\\n\\nThe stronger a reducing agent a metal \\nis, the greater its activity.\\n\\n\\n\\n951\\n\\nThe corresponding value of E°cell is given by\\n\\nE°cell = E°red + E°ox = E°red[H+|H2] + E°ox[Zn|Zn2+] = 0 V – E°red[Zn2+|Zn] = +0.76 V\\n\\nBecause E°cell > 0, the reaction is spontaneous and Zn(s) will produce H2(g) \\nfrom its reaction with HCl(aq) under standard conditions at 25.0°C. The rea-\\nson that E°cell > 0 is that E°red[Zn2+|Zn] < 0. In general, metals for which the value \\nof the standard reduction voltage is less than zero will react with acids to pro-\\nduce H2(g) under standard conditions.

The E°red values are used to predict \\nmany of the reactions that can occur between oxidizing and reducing agents.\\n\\nEXaMPlE 25-8: Use the data in Table 25.3 to determine whether \\nCo3+(aq), a fairly strong oxidizing agent, is capable of oxidizing water to \\nO2(g) in acidic aqueous solution under standard conditions at 25.0°C, \\naccording to the equation\\n\\n4 Co3+(aq) + 2 H2O(l ) → 4 Co2+(aq) + O2(g) + 4 H+(aq)\\n\\nSolution: The oxidation of H2O(l ) to O2(g) by Co3+(aq) under standard \\nconditions (Q = 1) will be a spontaneous process if E°cell = E°red + E°ox is \\ngreater than zero. The two half reaction equations are\\n\\n4 Co3+(aq) + 4 e− → 4 Co2+(aq) E°red = +1.92 V\\n\\n2 H2O(l ) → O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) + 4 e−  E°ox = –E°red = –1.23 V\\n\\nThe E°red values for the two half reactions were obtained from Table 25.3. \\nThe value of E°cell is\\n\\nE°cell = E°red[Co3+|Co2+] + E°ox[H2O|O2] = (1.92 V) + (–1.23 V) = +0.69 V\\n\\nAgain note that we do not multiply the value of E°red[Co3+|Co2+] by 4 because \\nthe magnitude of a cell voltage or half-cell voltage is independent of the \\nquantity of material involved or how we choose to (arbitrarily) write the \\nequations that describe the cell reaction. The positive value of E°cell means \\nthat Co3+(aq) is capable of oxidizing water at 25.0°C under standard condi-\\ntions. The rate of oxidation of water by Co3+(aq) is fairly rapid at 25.0°C, \\nand so Co3+(aq) does not persist at appreciable concentrations in water.\\n\\nPRaCTiCE PROblEM 25-8: The V2+(aq) ion is a moderately strong \\nreducing agent, V2+(aq) → V3+(aq) + e−, in acidic aqueous solution.

However, the \\nconcentrations of the various species given are not  at standard conditions \\nand so we must apply the Nernst equation (Equation 25.13),\\n\\n= 0.03850 V= 0 V – (0.01285 V)ln\\n0.100\\n—\\n2.00\\n\\n0.02570 V\\n—\\n\\n2� � ln= E°cell  – [Fe\\n2+(aq, 0.100 M)]/M\\n—-\\n[Fe2+(aq, 2.00 M)]/M\\n\\n0.02570 V\\n—\\n\\nνe� � ln QEcell = E°cell  –\\n\\n� �\\nThus, the cell generates 38.50 mV of electricity at 25.0°C.

The Electrical Energy Released from an Electrochemical Cell \\nCan do useful Work\\n\\nWe have shown that the voltage of an electrochemical cell is a measure of the \\ndriving force of the cell reaction toward equilibrium. A spontaneous cell reac-\\ntion creates a voltage difference between the electrodes that can be used to pro-\\nduce an electric current. Electrochemical cells therefore provide a mechanism \\nfor converting chemical energy into electrical energy. By calculating the Gibbs \\nenergy change for a reaction, we can determine how much electrical energy \\ncan be supplied to an external device, such as an electric motor. Equation 25.5,   \\nDGrxn = –neFEcell, relates the value of DGrxn directly to the cell voltage. From \\nChapter 23, we know that DGrxn is equal to the maximum amount of work, here \\nin the form of electrical energy, that can be obtained from the reaction.\\n\\nOne of the most important examples of an electrochemical cell is a fuel cell. \\nA fuel cell is an electrochemical cell in which the substance oxidized is capable \\nof being used as a fuel in a heat engine, that is, capable of being burned. A fuel \\ncell, then, is an electrochemical cell that carries out the oxidation of a fuel. The \\nreaction of the fuel with the oxidizer is the same as that for the combustion of \\nthe fuel, but the cell generates electricity directly, without a flame. The reac-\\ntants are continuously fed into the system so that it can derive power without \\ninterruption. The simplest type of fuel cell uses hydrogen and oxygen as fuel. \\nFuel cells are used as a source of electrical power in the Space Shuttle (Figure \\n25.12) and in some newer electric-powered buses and automobiles (Figure \\n25.13). Fuel cells are also being developed to power personal electronic devices \\nand are used as a method of storing electrical energy in some solar-powered \\nhomes. The development of fuel cells has received a great deal of attention in \\nrecent years, especially in view of our present energy shortfalls.\\n\\nFigure 25.12 The power plant used in the Space Shuttle. Each Space \\nShuttle is equipped with three hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell power plants. \\nEach power plant is capable of supplying 12 kilowatts at peak output and \\n7 kilowatts average power to the spacecraft’s electrical system.\\n\\nFigure 25.13 This fuel cell stack produced by Ballard \\nPower Systems in British Columbia can deliver up \\nto 1030 watts of electrical power from hydrogen gas. \\nAbout 15 of these stacks can generate enough energy \\nto power a medium-sized four-passenger electric car \\nwith only pure water as a waste product.\\n\\n\\n\\n25. ElECTROChEMiSTRy958\\n\\nFuel cells offer the possibility of achieving high thermodynamic efficiency in \\nthe conversion of Gibbs energy into mechanical work. Equation 23.7 shows that \\ninternal combustion engines can convert at best only the fraction (T2 – T1)/T2 of \\nthe energy as heat of combustion into mechanical work. In this relation, which \\ncomes from the second law of thermodynamics, T2 is the temperature of the gas \\nin the combustion region and T1 is its exhaust temperature. Fuel cells do not \\noperate like a heat engine and so are not subject to this limitation.\\n\\nFigure 25.14 shows a schematic diagram of a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. \\nHydrogen and oxygen are continuously pumped over platinum electrodes that \\nare separated by a proton exchange membrane. The membrane allows the flow \\nof protons between the two electrodes, while excluding the other species in the \\nreaction. The function of the membrane is similar to that of a salt bridge; it pro-\\nvides a path for the ion current while preventing the reactants at each of the two \\nelectrodes from mixing. The platinum electrodes in the cell function both as \\nan inert electrode and a catalyst for the oxidation of hydrogen gas.

This energy \\ncould be supplied by an electric current at an appropriate voltage, as is done in \\nelectrolysis, which we discuss in the next section.\\n\\n25-8. Electrolysis is described Quantitatively by Faraday’s laws\\nMichael Faraday (Frontispiece) investigated the effect of the passage of an elec-\\ntric current through various electrolyte solutions. Faraday’s primary observation \\nwas that the passage of an electric current through a solution causes the occur-\\nrence of chemical reactions that would not otherwise occur. The process by which a \\nchemical reaction is made to occur by the passage of an electric current through \\nthe solution is called electrolysis, and a cell that is used to perform electrolysis is \\ncalled an electrolytic cell (Figure 25.16). As noted in Section 25-2, the current \\nenters and leaves the solution in an electrolytic cell via the electrodes. Faraday \\ndiscovered that the metal ions of many salts are deposited as pure metal when an \\nelectric current is passed through aqueous solutions of their salts. In his studies of \\nelectrolysis, Faraday carried out an extensive series of experiments to determine \\n\\n\\n\\n25-8. ElECTROlySiS iS dESCRibEd QuanTiTaTiVEly by FaRaday’S laWS 961\\n\\nthe amount of electricity required to deposit measured quantities of metals on \\nelectrodes as a result of the passage of current through his electrolysis apparatus. \\nThe electrodes in Faraday’s experiments were electrochemically inert, in the sense \\nthat the electrode itself [e.g., Pt(s)] was unchanged by the passage of current.\\n\\nFaraday found that the quantity of a metal deposited at an electrode when \\nan electric current is passed through a solution of its salt depends on both the \\ncurrent and the stoichiometry of the half reaction that occurs. For example, \\nwhen pure silver is deposited from a solution of AgNO3(aq) and pure copper \\nis deposited from a separate solution of Cu(NO3)2(aq), the reactions that take \\nplace at the cathodes can be described by the half-reaction equations\\n\\n Ag+(aq) + e− → Ag(s)  (electrolysis of silver nitrate) (25.29)\\n\\nand\\n\\n Cu2+(aq) + 2 e− → Cu(s)  (electrolysis of copper nitrate) (25.30)\\n\\nSupplying one mole of electrons deposits one mole of silver from Ag+(aq), but \\ntwo moles of electrons are needed to deposit one mole of copper from Cu2+(aq) \\n(Figure 25.16). The number of electrons supplied to drive the reaction can be \\ncontrolled by regulating the electric current through the solution, which, along \\nwith the stoichiometry, determines the quantity of metal deposited.\\n\\nSuppose that a current of 0.850 amperes flows through each of the two solu-\\ntions described above for 20.0 minutes. The total charge, Z, that passes through \\neach solution is (Equation 25.2)\\n\\nZ  = It  = (0.850 C∙s–1)(20.0 min)(60 s∙min–1) = 1020 C\\n\\nThe number of moles of electrons that corresponds to a given amount of charge \\nthat flows through a solution, Z, can be determined using Faraday’s constant, F. \\nTherefore,\\n\\nFigure 25.16 Electrodeposition of silver \\nfrom AgNO3(aq) (left), and copper \\nfrom Cu(NO3)2(aq) (right). The same \\nquantity of electricity flows through \\nthe two solutions because they are \\nplaced in series. The number of moles \\nof silver deposited after a given time \\nis twice as great as the number of \\nmoles of copper deposited because \\nthe reduction of one mole of Ag+(aq) \\nrequires one mole of electrons, \\nwhereas the reduction of one mole \\nof Cu2+(aq) requires two moles of \\nelectrons.\\n\\n\\n\\n25.

First, we denote the molar \\nmass of the metal or gas produced by M and divide by the (unitless) stoichio-\\nmetric coefficient of the electrons, ne, in the half-reaction equation required to \\nproduce one formula unit of the substance.

ElECTROChEMiSTRy966\\n\\nyear in the United States. Most aluminum metal is produced by the electrolytic \\nHall-Héroult process, which was independently discovered around the same \\ntime by Charles Hall (Figure 25.20) in America and Paul Héroult (Figure 25.21) \\nin France. Prior to the development of this process, aluminum was considered \\na semiprecious metal that was produced by a process using potassium and later \\nsodium at a cost per gram greater than that of gold! The process for the elec-\\ntrochemical production of aluminum was patented independently by Hall and \\nHéroult in 1886, when they were each 23 years old. After prolonged litigation, \\nthey reached an agreement on the patent rights. Hall conceived his process \\nwhile an undergraduate student at Oberlin College in Ohio, performing all his \\nexperiments in a shed in his backyard using a blacksmith’s forge to heat the ore. \\nHéroult did all his work in old tannery buildings left to him by his late father. \\n\\nThey faced two major challenges in devising this process. The first was that \\naluminum metal cannot be produced by the electrolysis of an aqueous solution \\ncontaining Al3+(aq), because H+(aq) is reduced at an applied voltage much lower \\nthan that required to reduce Al3+(aq) at the cathode. The second challenge was \\nthat aluminum ores melt at temperatures above 2000°C, which exceeds the boil-\\ning point of aluminum metal, thus ruling out electrolysis of the molten ore. The \\nsolution to these problems was to use a molten salt electrolyte consisting of pow-\\ndered aluminum oxide, Al2O3(s), dissolved in the mineral cryolite, Na3AlF6(s). \\nAluminum oxide dissolves in cryolite to form a conductive solution with a melt-\\ning point low enough to allow the operation of the cell at temperatures below \\n1000°C.\\n\\nThe electrolysis apparatus used today is essentially the same as that used in \\nHall and Héroult’s original process. Figure 25.22 shows a portion of an electro-\\nchemical aluminum production facility in Massena, New York. The electrolysis \\nis carried out at about 980°C, at which temperature aluminum is a liquid and so \\ncan be siphoned off from the cathode compartment. Electrical contact to the \\nmolten aluminum cathode is made through a carbon shell that constitutes the \\nbottom of the electrode compartment. The consumable anodes are composed \\nof a petroleum coke that is obtained by heating to dryness the heavy petroleum \\nfraction remaining from petroleum refining. The equation for the overall elec-\\ntrochemical reaction is\\n\\nFigure 25.20 Charles Hall developed the electrolytic process for \\nthe production of aluminum while an undergraduate student at \\nOberlin College. His sister, Julia, who was also a chemistry major at \\nOberlin, was of great assistance to him, helping with experiments, \\nkeeping laboratory notes, and most important, giving him \\nsound business advice. Upon forming the Pittsburgh Reduction \\nCompany for the large-scale production of aluminum, the price \\nof aluminum went from over 12 dollars per pound to 30 cents \\nper pound. In 1907, the company was renamed the Aluminum \\nCompany of America, which was later shortened to Alcoa.\\n\\nFigure 25.21 Paul Héroult first \\nproduced aluminum electrolytically \\nafter a number of unsuccessful \\nattempts when he was 23 years old. \\nBoth Hall and Héroult filed for patents \\nin 1886, and after a prolonged patent \\nlitigation, a settlement was reached \\nbetween them. Héroult later invented \\nthe electric steel furnace, which was \\nuniversally adopted in the United \\nStates. Héroult was a free spirit. He \\nloved games, the company of women, \\ntravel, and good food and drink. He \\nspent his last years living on a 100-foot \\nyacht in the Mediterranean.

In recent years the energy \\ncost of aluminum production has dropped significantly, in large part due to \\nrecycling. The energy cost of recovering aluminum from recycled materials is \\nonly 6% that of manufacturing new aluminum from its ore. Prior to 1960 less \\nthan 18% of all aluminum produced was made from recycled materials; today \\nthat figure has climbed to about 48%.\\n\\nAluminum, which is a fairly reactive metal, protects itself from corrosion \\nby spontaneously forming a thin, tough, adherent layer of Al2O3(s). The oxide \\ncoating is what gives aluminum metal its dull cast. Electrolysis can be used to \\nprotect other reactive metals that do not self-protect as aluminum does. Using \\nelectrolysis, a thin layer of a relatively nonreactive metal such as nickel, chro-\\nmium, tin, silver, or gold is deposited on the surface of the reactive metal. The \\nproduction of a layer of protective metal by electrolysis is called electroplating. \\nFor example, electroplating can be used to coat base metals with a thin layer of \\ngold that functions both as a decorative and a protective coating. Electroplating \\nhas innumerable industrial applications, ranging from the manufacture of \\nheavy machinery to the production of microcircuits.\\n\\nSuMMaRy\\nAn electrochemical cell provides the means for obtaining electricity from an \\nelectron-transfer reaction. The cell consists of a pair of metal electrodes in con-\\ntact with an electrolyte solution. The dependence of the cell voltage on the \\nconcentrations of the reactants and products of the cell reaction is described \\nquantitatively by the Nernst equation.\\n\\nThe standard cell voltage, E°cell, is the voltage of the cell when the value \\nof the reaction quotient is unity (Q = 1). The equilibrium constant of the cell \\nreaction can be calculated from the value of E°cell. Electrode reactions can be \\narranged in a series of increasing electrode reduction voltages. The assignment \\nof standard reduction voltages to electrode reactions is achieved by setting E°red \\n= 0 for the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) reaction. The E°red values for \\nelectrode reactions given in Table 25.3 and Appendix G can be used to cal-\\nculate E°cell values for reactions and to predict the thermodynamic stability of \\noxidizing agents and reducing agents. Electrochemical cells can also be used to \\ndetermine the concentration of various ions in a solution and to measure pH.\\n\\nThe maximum possible amount of energy that can be obtained from \\nan electrochemical cell for the performance of useful work is given by  \\nDGrxn = –neFEcell, where Ecell is the cell voltage, F  is the Faraday constant (96 485 \\ncoulombs per mole of protons), and ne is the unitless stoichiometric coefficient \\nof the number of electrons transferred in the stated chemical equation describ-\\ning the cell reaction.\\n\\n Electrolysis is the process by which a chemical reaction is driven by the \\napplication of a voltage across electrodes placed in a solution. The extent to \\nwhich the electrochemical reaction occurs is proportional to the current that \\nflows through the solution, according to Faraday’s laws of electrolysis.\\n\\nFigure 25.22 The Hall-Héroult process \\non an industrial scale.

He then \\nmoved to Zurich and attended lectures at the Federal Technical High \\nSchool, where he became interested in the spatial arrangement of \\natoms in molecules. He received his doctorate from the University \\nof Zurich in 1892, during which time he laid the foundation of his \\nwork on coordination chemistry. Werner was appointed professor of \\nchemistry at the University of Zurich at the age of 29, where he first \\ngave lectures in organic chemistry and later in inorganic chemistry \\nas well. The structure of the compound CoCl3·6NH3(s), which was \\nan unsolved problem at the time, came to him in a dream, where he \\npictured a central Co3+ ion bonded to six NH3 molecules situated at \\nthe vertices of a regular octahedron to produce a [Co(NH3)6]3+ ion. \\nAt this time, he began the experiments that confirmed his theory of \\ncoordination, thus opening up the field of inorganic chemistry. He \\nremained at the University of Zurich until his retirement, although he \\nreceived many other offers of positions in Europe. He became a Swiss \\ncitizen in 1895. Werner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\nin 1913 for his work on coordination chemistry. He was the only \\ninorganic chemist to receive the Nobel Prize before 1973.\\n\\nWerner was a sociable man who was fond of billiards, chess, and \\nthe Swiss card game, Jass. He was an enthusiastic lecturer with a talent \\nfor making difficult concepts clear to his students. He developed \\narteriosclerosis, which forced him to give up his lectures in 1915 and \\nthen to retire in 1919. He died at the early age of 53.\\n\\n\\n\\n979\\n\\n26.

Human development itself was marked by progress to the \\nBronze Age and then to the Iron Age. The Industrial Revolution was powered \\nby steam engines made from steels. Today we rely on countless exotic transi-\\ntion metal compounds developed to meet specialized requirements as diverse \\nas those of space probes, personal computers, and ordinary house paint.\\n\\nWe shall not discuss the chemistry of all the transition metals in this chapter \\nbut shall focus mainly on the first transition metal series. Just as the first mem-\\nber in the main-group families differs significantly from the others, the chem-\\nistry of the first transition metal series also differs appreciably from that of the \\nother series. In particular, the aqueous solution chemistry of the first transition \\nmetal series is simpler than that of the heavier transition metals.\\n\\nThe transition metals have a rich and fascinating chemistry. In the first half \\nof the chapter we shall study the physical properties, uses, and important com-\\npounds of some selected transition metals. Then, in the second half of the chap-\\nter, we shall discuss the coordination chemistry of the transition metals and the \\nformation of transition metal complexes. Transition metal complexes are species \\nin which several anions or neutral molecules, called ligands, bond to a transition \\nmetal atom or ion. The chemistry of the transition metals is especially rich and \\ninteresting because of these complexes, which occur in a variety of geometries \\nand oxidation states. Much of the chemistry of transition metal complexes can \\nbe understood in terms of the electron occupancy of the d orbitals of the metal \\nion. We use d-orbital electron configurations to explain many of the spectral, \\nmagnetic, and structural properties of transition metal complexes.\\n\\n\\n\\n26.

The CheMisTry of The TrAnsiTion MeTAls982\\n\\nScandium\\nThe ground-state electron configuration of scandium is [Ar]4s23d 1. Scandium \\nis somewhat similar to aluminum in its chemical properties. Scandium has a +3 \\noxidation state in almost all its compounds. The common oxidation states of the \\n3d transition metals are given in Table 26.2. It forms a very stable oxide, Sc2O3(s), \\nand forms halides with the formula ScX3. The addition of a base to Sc3+(aq) \\nproduces a white, gelatinous precipitate with the formula Sc2O3·nH2O(s). Like \\nAl(OH)3(s), hydrated Sc2O3(s) is amphoteric (see Section 22-7). Scandium and \\nits compounds have little technological importance at present.\\n\\nTitanium\\nThe ground state electron configuration of titanium is [Ar]4s23d 2. Its most com-\\nmon and stable oxidation state by far is +4, as in the compounds TiO2(s) and \\nTiCl4(l ), which are covalently bonded.\\n\\nPure titanium is a lustrous white metal (Figure 26.3) and is the second most \\nabundant transition metal. It is used to make lightweight alloys that are stable at \\nhigh temperatures and are used in missiles, high-performance aircraft, bicycles, \\nmachine tool coatings, and dental work. Titanium is as strong as most steels but \\n50% lighter. It is 60% denser than aluminum but twice as strong. In addition, it \\nhas excellent resistance to corrosion.\\n\\nPure titanium is difficult to prepare because the metal is very reactive at \\nhigh temperatures. The most important ore of titanium is rutile, which is pri-\\nmarily TiO2(s) (Figure 26.4). Pure titanium metal is produced by first convert-\\ning TiO2(s) to TiCl4(l ) by heating TiO2(s) to red heat in the presence of carbon \\nand chlorine, as described by\\n\\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ TiCl4(l ) + CO2(g)\\nhigh temperature\\n\\nTiO2(s) + C(s) + 2 Cl2(g)\\n\\nThe TiCl4(l ), which is a colorless, fuming covalent liquid, is reduced to the metal \\nby reacting it with magnesium in an inert atmosphere of argon, according to\\n\\nTiCl4(l ) + 2 Mg(s) → Ti(s) + 2 MgCl2(s)\\n\\nTABle 26.2 The common oxidation \\nstates of the 3d transition metals\\n\\nElement\\nCommon \\noxidation states\\n\\nscandium\\n\\ntitanium\\n\\nvanadium\\n\\nchromium\\n\\nmanganese\\n\\niron\\n\\ncobalt\\n\\nnickel\\n\\ncopper\\n\\nzinc\\n\\n+3\\n\\n+4\\n\\n+2, +3, +4, +5\\n\\n+2, +3, +6\\n\\n+2, +4, +7\\n\\n+2, +3\\n\\n+2, +3\\n\\n+2\\n\\n+1, +2\\n\\n+2\\n\\nfigure 26.3 Titanium has a relatively low density, high strength, and \\nexcellent corrosion resistance.\\n\\nfigure 26.4 Rutile, an ore of \\ntitanium.\\n\\n\\n\\n26-1.

Titanium tetrachloride is used to make smoke screens; when it is sprayed \\ninto the air, it reacts with moisture to produce a dense and persistent white \\ncloud of TiO2(s). The chemical equation for the reaction of TiCl4(l ) with water \\nvapor is\\n\\nTiCl4(l ) + 2 H2O(g) → TiO2(s) + 4 HCl(g)\\n\\nSome commercially important titanium compounds are given in Table 26.3.\\n\\nVanadium\\nThe ground state electron configuration of vanadium is [Ar]4s23d 3. Its maxi-\\nmum oxidation state is +5, although the +2, +3, and +4 oxidation states are com-\\nmon, with the +2 state being the least common. Vanadium(V) oxide is obtained \\nwhen vanadium is burned in excess oxygen. It is used as a catalyst in several \\nindustrial processes, including the oxidation of SO2(g) to SO3(g) that is one \\nstep in the production of sulfuric acid by the contact process (Interchapter J).\\n\\nVanadium(V) oxide is amphoteric. It dissolves in concentrated bases such as \\nNaOH(aq) to produce a colorless solution in which the principal species above \\npH = 13 is believed to be VO4\\n\\n3−(aq). As the pH is lowered, the solution turns \\norange, and at pH = 2, a precipitate occurs that redissolves at a lower pH to give \\na pale yellow solution, in which the principal species is believed to be VO2\\n\\n+(aq) \\n(Figure 26.5).\\n\\nTABle 26.3 important compounds of titanium, vanadium, chromium, and manganese\\n\\nCompound Uses\\n\\ntitanium dioxide, TiO2(s) ceramic colorant; white paints and lacquers; inks and plastics; gemstones\\n\\ntitanium tetrachloride, TiCl4(l) smoke screens; iridescent glass; artificial pearls\\n\\nvanadium (V ) oxide, V2O5(s) production of sulfuric acid; manufacture of yellow glass\\n\\nvanadyl sulfate, VOSO4(s) blue- and green-colored glasses and glazes on pottery\\n\\nchromium(IV) oxide, CrO2(s) constituent of high-fidelity magnetic recording tapes\\n\\nchromium(III) oxide, Cr2O3(s) constituent of abrasives, refractory materials, and semiconductors; green \\npigment, especially for coloring glass\\n\\nsodium dichromate, Na2Cr2O7(s) leather tanning; textile manufacture; metal corrosion inhibitor\\n\\nmanganese(IV) oxide, MnO2(s) manufacture of manganese steel; alkaline batteries; printing and dyeing \\ntextiles; pigment in brick industry\\n\\nmanganese(II) sulfate, MnSO4(s) dyeing; red glazes on porcelain; fertilizers for vines, tobacco\\n\\npotassium permanganate, KMnO4(s) oxidizing agent; medical disinfectant (bladder infection); water and air \\npurification\\n\\nsee interchapter J at  \\nwww.McQuarrieGeneralChemistry.com.\\n\\n\\n\\n26.

The +6 oxidation state of Chromium and the +7 oxidation \\nstate of Manganese Are strongly oxidizing\\n\\nChromium\\nChromium, with the ground state electron configuration [Ar]4s13d 5, has a max-\\nimum oxidation state of +6, although the +2 and +3 states are common (Figure \\n26.6). Whereas the +4 oxidation state for titanium and the +5 state of vanadium \\nare only mildly oxidizing, the +6 oxidation state of chromium is strongly oxidiz ing. \\nIndeed, the dichromate ion, Cr2O7\\n\\n2−(aq) in acidic solution is a strong oxidiz-\\ning agent:\\n\\n14 H+(aq) + Cr2O7\\n2−(aq) + 6 e− → 2 Cr3+(aq) + 7 H2O(l )  E°red = 1.232 V\\n\\nRecall from our discussion in Section 25-5 that the larger a positive value \\nof E°red, the stronger the agent’s oxidizing power.

The chromous bubbler \\nsolution is prepared by reacting zinc from a zinc-mercury amalgam, Zn(Hg)(s), \\nwith an aqueous chromium(III) solution to form Cr2+(aq) as described by\\n\\nZn(Hg)(s) + 2 Cr3+(aq) → 2 Cr2+(aq) + Zn2+(aq)\\n\\nThe resulting chromium(II) nitrate, Cr(NO3)2(aq), solution reduces oxygen to \\nwater as oxygen is bubbled through the solution according to\\n\\n4 Cr2+(aq) + O2(g) + 4 H+(aq) → 4 Cr3+(aq) + 2 H2O(l )\\n\\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction equation is very large, making it \\nessentially a quantitative reaction.\\n\\nChromium metal is used in catalysis, to harden steel, to manufacture stain-\\nless steel, and to form various alloys. Chromium metal is also used in electro-\\nplating to form corrosion-resistant “chrome” surfaces. Sources and uses of \\nchromium are summarized in Table 26.1, and some important chromium com-\\npounds are given in Table 26.3.\\n\\nManganese\\nThe ground state electron configuration of manganese is [Ar]4s23d 5. The high-\\nest oxidation state of manganese is +7, which is best known in the strongly oxi-\\ndizing permanganate ion, MnO4−(aq), which reacts in both acidic and basic solu-\\ntions according to\\n\\nAcidic solution\\n\\nMnO4−(aq) + 8 H+(aq) + 5 e− → Mn2+(aq) + 4 H2O(l )  E°red = +1.507 V\\n\\nBasic solution\\n\\nMnO4−(aq) + 2 H2O(l ) + 3 e− → MnO2(s) + 4 OH−(aq)  E°red = +0.595 V\\n\\nThe most important permanganate salt is potassium permanganate, \\nKMnO4(s), that is used as an oxidizing agent in industry and medicine, as \\nwell as in many general chemistry laboratories. Freshly prepared solutions \\nof KMnO4(aq) have a deep purple color but turn brown on long standing \\nbecause MnO4−(aq) oxidizes water to oxygen and is thereby reduced to MnO2(s) \\n(Figure 26.8).

For the \\n\\n+3 and +4 oxidation states, the most important compounds are the oxides \\nMn2O3(s) and MnO2(s). Manganese(IV) oxide as the mineral pyrolusite is an \\nimportant ore of manganese and is the source of most manganese compounds. \\nCommercially important manganese compounds are given in Table 26.3.\\n\\nfigure 26.7 Left, a chromous bubbler, \\nwhich is used to remove traces of \\noxygen from unreactive gases such as \\nnitrogen or argon. The blue color of \\nthe solution is due to Cr2+(aq), and the \\nsolid at the bottom of the tube is a zinc \\namalgam, Zn(Hg)(s). The gas to be \\ndeoxygenated enters the bubbler at the \\nleft inlet tube, bubbles up through the \\nsolution of Cr2+(aq), and exits from the \\nright tube. A glass membrane at the \\nbottom of the inlet tube breaks up the \\nentering gas stream into small bubbles. \\nRight, the green solution in the \\ngraduated cylinder is Cr2(NO3)3(aq), \\nwhich is used to prepare the chromous \\nbubbler.

The highest known oxidation state of iron is +6, but it is very rare. \\nOnly the +2 and +3 oxidation states of iron are common.\\n\\nIron is found in nature as hematite, Fe2O3(s); magnetite, Fe3O4(s); siderite, \\nFeCO3(s); and iron pyrite, FeS2(s), called fool’s gold (Figure 26.9). It is the \\nmost abundant transition metal, constituting 4.7% by mass of the earth’s crust. \\nIt is the cheapest metal, and, in the form of steel, the most useful. Pure iron is \\na silvery white, soft metal that rusts rapidly in moist air. We have already dis-\\ncussed this familiar example of corrosion in Section 24-7. Iron is little used as \\nthe pure element but is strengthened greatly by the addition of small amounts \\nof carbon and of various other transition metals.

It occurs in a number \\nof proteins, such as hemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to \\nmuscles and other tissues, where the oxygen is used in the cellular oxidation \\nreactions. It has been estimated that an adult human being contains about five \\ngrams of iron.\\n\\nMillions of tons of iron are produced annually in the United States by \\nthe reaction of Fe2O3(s) with coke (coal from which the volatile components \\nhave been driven off). This reaction is carried out in a blast furnace. About \\n30 meters high and 8 meters wide, the modern blast furnace produces about \\n5000 metric tons of iron daily (Figure 26.10). A mixture of iron ore, coke, and \\nlimestone, CaCO3(s), is loaded into the top, and preheated compressed air and \\noxygen are blown in near the bottom. The reaction of the coke and the oxygen \\nto produce carbon dioxide gives off a great deal of heat, and the temperature \\nin the lower region of a blast furnace is around 1900°C. As the CO2(g) rises, it \\nreacts with more coke to produce hot carbon monoxide, which reduces the iron \\nore to iron according to\\n\\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ 2 Fe(l) + 3 CO2(g)\\nhigh temp\\n\\nFe2O3(l ) + 3 CO(g)\\n\\nOxygen-enriched air\\n\\nMolten iron\\nPig iron\\n\\nSlag\\n1900°C\\n\\n1300°C\\n\\n1000°C\\n\\n800°C\\n\\n200°C\\n\\nC(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)   \\n\\nCO2(g) + C(s) → 2 CO(g)\\n\\nCaO(s) + SiO2(s) → CaSiO3(l)\\n\\nCaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)\\n\\nFe2O3(l) + 3 CO(g) → 2 Fe(l) + 3 CO2(g)\\n\\nSlag formation\\n\\nExhaust\\ngases\\n\\nIron ore,\\nlimestone,\\n\\ncoke\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n10/05/09\\n\\n026-010 (984)\\n\\nfigure 26.10 Iron is produced in a blast furnace. \\nA typical blast furnace like the one shown in this \\ndiagram runs continuously and consumes about 120 \\nrailroad cars of iron ore, 50 railroad cars of coke, and \\n40 railroad cars of limestone per day. The 5000 tons \\nof iron produced requires about 75 railroad cars to \\ntransport it.\\n\\n\\n\\n26. The CheMisTry of The TrAnsiTion MeTAls988\\n\\nThe molten iron metal is denser than the other substances and drops to the \\nbottom, where it can be drained off to form ingots of what is called pig iron.\\n\\nThe function of the limestone is to remove the sand and gravel that normally \\ncontaminate the iron ore. The intense heat decomposes the limestone to CaO(s) \\nand CO2(g). The CaO(s) combines with the sand and gravel (both of which are \\nprimarily silicon dioxide) to form molten calcium silicate, CaSiO3(l).\\n\\nCaO(s) + SiO2(s) → CaSiO3(l )\\nslag\\n\\nThe molten calcium silicate, called slag, floats on top of the molten iron and \\nis drained off periodically. It is used in building materials, such as cement and \\nconcrete aggregate, rock-wool insulation, cinder blocks, and as railroad ballast.\\n\\nPig iron contains about 4 or 5% carbon together with lesser amounts of \\nsilicon, manganese, phosphorus, and sulfur. It is brittle, difficult to weld, and \\nnot strong enough for structural applications. To be useful, pig iron must be \\nconverted to steel, which is an alloy of iron with small but controlled amounts of \\nother metals and between 0.1 and 1.5% carbon. Steel is made from pig iron in \\nseveral different processes, all of which use oxygen to oxidize most of the impu-\\nrities. One such process is the basic oxygen process, in which hot, pure O2(g) \\nis blown through molten pig iron (Figure 26.11). The oxidation of carbon and \\nphosphorus is complete in less than one hour. The desired carbon content of \\nthe steel is then achieved by adding high-carbon steel alloy.\\n\\nThere are two types of steels: carbon steels and alloy steels. Both types con-\\ntain carbon, but carbon steels contain essentially no other metals besides iron. \\nAbout 90% of all steel produced is carbon steel. Carbon steel that contains less \\nthan 0.2% carbon is called mild steel. Mild steels are malleable and ductile and \\nare used where load-bearing ability is not a consideration.

A stream of hot oxygen \\nis blown through the molten mixture, \\nand the oxidized impurities are blown \\nout of the iron. High-quality steel is \\nproduced in an hour or less.\\n\\n\\n\\n26-4.

High-carbon steels contain 0.8 to 1.5% \\ncarbon and are used to make drill bits, knives, and other tools in which hard-\\nness is important.\\n\\nAlloy steels contain other metals in small amounts. Different metals give \\ndifferent properties to steels. The alloy steels called stainless steels contain \\nhigh percentages of chromium and nickel. Stainless steels resist corrosion and \\nare used for cutlery and hospital equipment. The most common stainless steel \\ncontains 18% chromium and 8% nickel.\\n\\n26-4.  The +2 oxidation state is the Most important oxidation \\nstate for Cobalt, nickel, Copper, and Zinc\\n\\nAs we go from iron to zinc, there is an increasing prominence of the +2 oxida-\\ntion state. Most compounds of cobalt and almost all compounds of nickel and \\nzinc involve the metal in the +2 oxidation state. Only copper, which has an \\nimportant +1 oxidation state, and cobalt, which has an important +3 oxidation \\nstate, have extensive chemistries not involving the +2 state.\\n\\nCobalt\\nCobalt is a fairly rare element and is usually found associated with nickel in \\nnature. It is a hard, bluish-white metal that is used in the manufacture of \\nhigh-temperature alloys such as alnico, an aluminum-nickel-cobalt alloy used \\nin permanent magnets. The pure metal is relatively unreactive and dissolves \\nonly slowly in dilute mineral acids. When cobalt is burned in oxygen, a mix-\\nture of CoO(s) and Co3O4(s) is obtained. Blue “cobalt” glass contains a small \\namount of CoO(s) (Figure 26.12). Most simple cobalt salts involve Co(II). The \\nspecies Co3+(aq) is a strong oxidizing agent, E°red[Co3+|Co2+] = 1.92 V, and can \\noxidize water. Cobalt is an important element in the computer industry; vari-\\nous alloys of cobalt are used as the media (magnetic surface material) of most \\nhard disk drives. Other commercially important cobalt compounds are given in \\nTable 26.5.\\n\\nfigure 26.12 Cobalt glass.

The CheMisTry of The TrAnsiTion MeTAls990\\n\\nNickel\\nNickel occurs in a variety of sulfide ores, the most important deposit being found \\nin the Sudbury basin of Ontario, Canada. The metal is obtained by roasting the \\nore to obtain NiO(s) and then reducing with hydrogen or carbon. Very pure \\nnickel is obtained by electrolysis. Nickel is a silvery metal that takes a beautiful \\nhigh polish, which is protected by a spontaneously formed transparent layer \\nof the oxide NiO(s). It is used in a number of magnetic alloys and in the alloy \\nMonel, which is used to handle fluorine and other reactive fluorine compounds.\\n\\nNickel is more reactive than cobalt and dissolves readily in dilute acids. The \\naqueous solution chemistry of nickel involves primarily the species Ni2+(aq). \\nImportant nickel compounds are given in Table 26.5.\\n\\nCopper\\nCopper is only slightly less abundant than nickel. Deposits of the free metal are \\nvery rare; it generally occurs as various sulfides. Most copper-containing depos-\\nits have a copper content of less than 1%, although some richer deposits have up \\nto 4% copper (Figure 26.13). Copper ores contain other metals and semimetals \\nsuch as selenium and tellurium, which are important by-products of copper \\nproduction. Important copper minerals are chalcocite, Cu2S(s); chalcopyrite, \\nCuFeS2(s); and malachite, CuCO3·Cu(OH)2(s). The total world output of cop-\\nper metal is about 10 million metric tons, with U.S. production accounting for \\nover 10% of the total. The extraction of copper from its ores is a multistep pro-\\ncess, the final step being purification by electrolysis (Section 25-9).\\n\\nCopper is a reddish, soft, ductile metal that takes on a bright metallic luster. Its \\nimportant use is as an electrical conductor. The only metal that is a better conduc-\\ntor is silver, but the price of silver precludes its widespread use. Although copper \\nis fairly unreactive, its surface turns green after long exposure to the atmosphere. \\nThe green patina (Figure 26.14) is due to the surface formation of copper hydroxo-\\ncarbonate, Cu2(OH)2CO3(s) and copper hydroxosulfate, Cu3(OH)4SO4(s).\\n\\nfigure 26.13 An open pit copper mine \\nat Bingham Canyon, located about \\n25 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, \\nUtah.

Bronze usually contains from 5 to 10% \\ntin and is very resistant to corrosion. It is used for casting, marine equipment, \\nfine arts work, and spark-resistant tools. Yellow brasses contain about 35% zinc \\nand have good ductility and high strength. Brass is used for piping, valves, hose \\nnozzles, marine equipment, and jewelry and in the fine arts.\\n\\nCopper does not replace hydrogen from dilute acids, but it does react with \\noxidizing acids such as concentrated nitric acid or hot concentrated sulfuric \\nacid according to\\n\\n3 Cu(s) + 8 HNO3(aq) → 3 Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2 NO(g) + 4 H2O(l )\\n\\nCu(s) + 2 H2SO4(conc) → CuSO4(aq) + 2 H2O(l ) + SO2(g)\\n\\nCommercially important copper compounds are given in Table 26.6.\\nMost compounds of copper involve copper(II), many of which are blue \\n\\nor bluish-green. The most common copper(II) salt is copper(II) sulfate pen-\\ntahydrate, CuSO4 · 5H2O(s), which occurs as beautiful blue crystals (Figure \\n26.15). When the crystals are heated gently, the water of hydration is driven \\noff to produce anhydrous copper(II) sulfate, CuSO4(s), which is a white pow-\\nder (Figure 26.15). When NH3(aq) is added to aqueous solutions containing \\nCu2+(aq), an intense dark blue color occurs as a result of the formation of a \\ncopper-ammonia complex ion according to\\n\\n[Cu(H2O)6]2+(aq) + 4 NH3(aq) → [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+(aq) + 4 H2O(l )\\n\\nTABle 26.6 important compounds of copper and zinc\\n\\nCompound Uses\\n\\ncopper(II) arsenite, \\nCu(AsO2)2(s) (Scheele’s green)\\n\\npigment; wood preservative; insecticide, fungicide, rodenticide, \\nmosquito control\\n\\ncopper(II) nitrate, Cu(NO3)2(s) light-sensitive paper; insecticide for vines; wood preservative\\n\\ncopper(I) oxide, Cu2O(s) antifouling paints for wood and steel exposed to seawater; \\nfungicide; porcelain red glaze; red glass\\n\\ncopper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, \\nCuSO4 · 5H2O(s)\\n\\nsoil and feed additive; germicide; petroleum and rubber \\nindustries; laundry and metal-marking inks\\n\\nzinc carbonate, ZnCO3(s) white pigment; porcelain, pottery, and rubber manufacture; \\nastringent and antiseptic\\n\\nzinc chloride, ZnCl2(s) deodorants; disinfectants; fireproofing and preserving wood; \\nadhesives; dental cements; taxidermist fluid; artificial silk; \\nparchment paper\\n\\nzinc oxide, ZnO(s) ointment; pigment and mold inhibitor in paints; floor tile; \\ncosmetics; color photography; dental cements; automobile tires\\n\\nfigure 26.14 The green patina \\nof the Statue of Liberty is due to \\nthe surface formation of copper \\nhydroxocarbonate and hydroxosulfate \\ncompounds.

Zinc is a shiny white metal with a bluish-gray luster.\\n\\nThe 3d subshell of zinc is completely filled, so zinc behaves more like a \\nGroup 2 metal than like a transition metal. Metallic zinc is a strong reducing \\nagent. It dissolves readily in dilute acids and combines with oxygen, sulfur, \\nphosphorus, and the halogens upon being heated. The only important oxida-\\ntion state of zinc is +2, and zinc(II) salts are colorless, unless color is imparted \\nby the anion. Zinc is found in nearly every cell in the body, particularly in the \\nskin, hair, nails, eyes, and testes. It is required for the proper healing of wounds, \\nhealthy skin and hair, and male virility. The human body contains about two \\ngrams of zinc. Commercially important zinc(II) salts are given in Table 26.6.\\n\\n26-5.  Gold, silver, and Mercury have Been known since  \\nAncient Times\\n\\nGold has been mined since at least 4000 BC.

Mercury is thought to have been \\ndiscovered later than gold and silver and has been found in Egyptian tombs \\ndating from 1500 BC. \\n\\nGold\\nGold is a very dense, soft, yellow metal with a high luster (Figure 26.17). It is \\nfound in nature as the free element and in tellurides. It occurs in veins and \\nalluvial deposits and is often separated from rocks and other minerals by sluic-\\ning or panning. Over two-thirds of the gold produced by the Western world \\ncomes from South Africa. In many mining operations, about five grams of gold \\nis recovered from one ton of rock.\\n\\nPure gold is soft and often alloyed to make it harder. The amount of gold in \\nan alloy is expressed in karats: pure gold is 24 karat; coinage gold is 22 karat, \\nor (22/24) × 100 = 92%. White gold, which is used in jewelry, is usually an alloy \\nof gold and nickel. Gold is very unreactive, so it has a remarkable resistance to \\ncorrosion. It is also an excellent conductor of electricity. In addition to its use \\nin jewelry and as a world monetary standard, gold is used in microelectronic \\ndevices (Figure 26.18). It is also used extensively in dentistry for tooth crowns.\\n\\nGold is extracted from ores by reaction with sodium cyanide, NaCN(aq), \\nand oxygen according to\\n\\n4 Au(s) + 8 CN−(aq) + O2(g) + 2 H2O(l ) → 4[Au(CN)2]−(aq) + 4 OH−(aq)\\n\\nThis oxidation-reduction reaction is driven by the formation of the very stable \\n\\nfigure 26.17 Gold often occurs in \\nthe free state in nature.

Important gold compounds are listed in Table 26.7.\\n\\nSilver\\nSilver is a lustrous, white metal whose ductility and malleability are exceeded \\nonly by those of gold and palladium. Pure silver also has the highest electri-\\ncal conductivity of all metals. Most of the silver produced today is a by-prod-\\nuct of the production of other metals such as copper, lead, and zinc. Its uses \\ninclude jewelry, silverware, wires, coinage, and in silver-zinc button batteries \\n(see Interchapter U). Other important compounds appear in Table 26.7.\\n\\nThe silver halides illustrate the phenomenon that the first member of a fam-\\nily in the periodic table may differ some from the others. Although AgCl(s), \\nAgBr(s), and AgI(s) are insoluble in water, AgF(s) is very soluble, having a solu-\\nbility in water of 1800 g·L−1.\\n\\nMercury\\nLike gold and silver, mercury has been known for thousands of years; it used \\nto be called quicksilver because it is the only metal that is a liquid at 25°C and \\noften forms small balls that move around rapidly on uneven surfaces. The prin-\\ncipal ore of mercury is cinnabar, HgS(s), which was widely used in the ancient \\nworld as a vermilion pigment (Figure 26.19). The most extensive and richest \\ndeposits of cinnabar occur in the Almaden region of Spain, the world’s largest \\nproducer of mercury. The metal is easily recovered from its ore by roasting as \\ndescribed by the chemical equation\\n\\nHgS(s) + O2(g) → Hg(l ) + SO2(g)\\n\\nThe mercury is then purified by distillation.\\nMercury is not very reactive. On being heated, it reacts with oxygen, sul-\\n\\nfur, and the halogens, but not with nitrogen, phosphorus, hydrogen, or car-\\nbon. When mercury is heated in air to around 300°C, it reacts with oxygen to \\nproduce the bright orange–red mercury(II) oxide, HgO(s). When HgO(s) is \\nheated to about 400°C, it decomposes according to\\n\\n2 Hg(l) + O2(g)\\n400°C2 HgO(s) \\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→\\n\\nLike copper, mercury does not replace hydrogen from acids, but it does \\nreact with oxidizing acids such as concentrated nitric acid or hot concentrated \\nsulfuric acid according to\\n\\n3 Hg(l ) + 8 HNO3(aq) → 3 Hg(NO3)2(aq) + 2 NO(g) + 4 H2O(l )\\n\\nHg(l ) + 2 H2SO4(aq) → HgSO4(aq) + SO2(aq) + 2 H2O(l )\\n\\nMercury compounds occur as Hg(I) or Hg(II), with Hg(II) being the more \\ncommon oxidation state.

A notable feature of Hg(I) salts is that they consist \\nof the diatomic Hg2\\n\\n2+ ion. Many of the salts of Hg(I) and Hg(II) are covalently \\nbonded. Some mercury compounds are listed in Table 26.7.\\n\\nMercury compounds are poisonous and were once used in insecticides, fun-\\ngicides, rodenticides, and disinfectants. Mercury was believed by alchemists to \\nbe an essential ingredient in longevity potions, often to deadly effect. In the \\nlast century, mercury compounds were used in the production of felt for hats; \\nthe felt workers suffered from a nervous disorder called “hatter’s shakes,” which \\nled to the expression “mad as a hatter.” The discharge of mercury-containing \\nindustrial wastes into rivers, lakes, and oceans caused serious environmental \\nproblems, culminating in the Minamata disaster in Japan in 1952, when over \\n50 people died of mercury poisoning. The mercury effluent was converted to \\nthe organomercury compounds by certain sedimentary bacteria, entered the \\nmarine food chain, and became concentrated in fish, which was the main diet \\nof the fishing village of Minamata. Since then, the disposal of mercury wastes \\nhas been regulated and mercury levels in food are constantly monitored. In \\n1972, more than 90 nations agreed on an international ban on the dumping of \\nmercury wastes. In addition, many countries have now banned or have placed \\nlimits on the use of mercury and mercury-containing compounds.\\n\\n26-6.  each d-Block Transition Metal ion has a Characteristic \\nnumber of d electrons\\n\\nMuch of the chemistry of the transition metals is determined by the shape of \\nthe d  orbitals. The shapes and relative spatial orientations of the five d  orbitals \\nare shown in Figure 26.20. (see also Section 5-11). These orbitals are distin-\\nguished by x, y, and z  subscripts that define the orientation of the orbitals with \\nrespect to the x, y, and z  coordinate axes. Thus, the d orbitals are named dxy, dxz, \\ndyz, dx2−y2, and dz2 orbitals. In the absence of any external electric or magnetic \\nfield, the energies of the five d orbitals for a given value of the principal quan-\\ntum number are equal.\\n\\nNow consider transition metal ions. Recall from Chapters 5 and 6 that the \\norder of filling of the orbitals in these ions is regular in the sense that it follows \\nthe arithmetic sequence: the n = 1 shell is filled first, then n = 2, then n = 3, and \\nso on, until all the electrons are accommodated. For example, the ten ions of \\nthe 3d series with oxidation state +2 are\\n\\nd 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 d 5 d 6 d 7 d 8 d 9 d 10\\n\\nSc(II) Ti(II) V(II) Cr(II) Mn(II) Fe(II) Co(II) Ni(II) Cu(II) Zn(II)\\n21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\\n\\nWe write the d-orbital electrons as dx, where the d  indicates the set of orbit-\\nals and the x  indicates the number of electrons in the d  orbitals. In general, a \\ntransition-metal ion with x d  electrons is called a dx ion. Below the designation \\ndx, we have given the symbol for the ion, with its oxidation state in parentheses. \\nThe row of numbers below the ion symbols shows the corresponding atomic \\nnumber of each element. Note that the second digit in the atomic number for \\nthe M(II) ions is the same as the number of d  electrons, except for zinc where 0 \\nis interpreted as 10. For example, scandium is element 21 and Sc(II) is a d 1 ion; \\nmanganese is element 25 and Mn(II) is a d 5 ion. We can use this rule to quickly \\nfind the number of d electrons in any 3d-series transition-metal ion.\\n\\n26-6.  eACh d-BloCk TrAnsiTion MeTAl ion hAs A ChArACTerisTiC nuMBer of d eleCTrons\\n\\nJust as we observed that not all atoms \\nfollow the same orbital filling order, so \\ntoo there are exceptions to the orbital \\nfilling order of certain transition metal \\nions. however, for simplicity, we shall \\ntake the orbital filling order of all such \\nions to be regular.\\n\\n\\n\\n26. The CheMisTry of The TrAnsiTion MeTAls996\\n\\nThe M(III) ions of the 3d  series have one fewer electron than the M(II) \\nions. Thus, for example, Fe(II) and Co(III) both have six d  electrons; for this \\nreason they both are called d 6 ions. Removal of an electron from Fe(II) yields \\nFe(III), which is a d 5 ion.\\n\\nFor ions in the 4d series, we can quickly determine the number of d electrons \\nby noting the position of the element relative to those of the 3d series. For exam-\\nple, rhodium is directly below cobalt (element 27); thus, Rh(II) is a d 7 ion. For \\nions in the 5d series, the second digit of the atomic number again correlates with \\nthe number of d electrons in the M(II) ion. Thus, Pt(II) (Z = 78) is a d 8 ion.\\n\\nexAMPle 26-1: Determine the number of outer-shell d electrons in \\nIr(III), Pt(IV), and Mo(III).\\n\\nSolution: Iridium(II) (Z = 77) is a d7 ion; so Ir(III), which has one fewer \\nelectron, is a d 6 ion. For platinum, Z = 78; so Pt(II) is a d 8 ion. Platinum(IV) \\nhas two fewer electrons than Pt(II); so Pt(IV) is a d 6 ion. Molybdenum \\n(Z = 42) is below chromium (Z = 24); so Mo(II) is a d 4 ion and Mo(III), \\nwhich has one fewer electron than Mo(II), is a d 3 ion.\\n\\nz z\\n\\nz\\nz\\n\\nx x\\n\\nx\\nx\\n\\ny\\n\\ny\\n\\nz\\n\\nx\\ny\\n\\ny\\n\\ny\\n\\ndxy dyz dxz\\n\\nThe four lobes lie between\\nthe y and z axes in the four\\nquadrants on the yz plane.\\n\\nThe four lobes lie between\\nthe x and y axes in the four\\nquadrants on the xy plane.\\n\\nThe four lobes lie between\\nthe x and z axes in the four\\nquadrants on the xz plane.\\n\\nThe four lobes lie along\\nthe x and y axes.\\n\\nTwo lobes are on the z axis and a\\ndonut-shaped lobe is symmetrically\\nplaced on the xy plane.\\n \\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nFigure #\\n\\nArtist\\n\\nDate\\n\\nTitle\\n\\nCheck if revision Approved\\n\\nGeneral Chemistry - 4th ed\\n\\nMcQuarrie/Gallogy\\n\\nGeorge Kelvin\\n\\n06/09/11\\n\\n026-020 (995)\\n\\nx\\n\\nReplacement\\n\\ndx2 – y2\\ndz2 \\n\\nfigure 26.20 The shapes and relative \\norientations of the five d orbitals.\\n\\n\\n\\n26-7.

Transition Metal Complexes Consist of Central Metal Atoms \\nor ions That Are Bonded to ligands\\n\\nSimple cyanide salts, such as sodium cyanide, NaCN(s), are deadly poisons. An \\naqueous solution of NaCN(aq) contains the ions Na+(aq) and CN−(aq), and the \\nsolution is colorless. The toxicity is due to the CN−(aq) ions, which bind to iron \\nin the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase found in our cells’ mitochondria, block-\\ning the binding of oxygen to this protein. This effectively shuts down our cells’ \\nability to produce the energy needed for tissue such as our heart and nervous \\nsystem. If excess iron(II) nitrate, Fe(NO3)2(aq), is added to NaCN(aq), then the \\nsolution turns yellow. Chemical tests show that CN−(aq) is no longer present and \\nthat the solution, although still somewhat poisonous, no longer causes essen-\\ntially instantaneous death. What happens is that CN−(aq) reacts with Fe2+(aq) \\nto form the ion [Fe(CN)6]4−(aq), in which six cyanide ions are bonded directly \\nto the iron ion in an octahedral structure. The [Fe(CN)6]4−(aq) ions exist in \\nsolution as integral units called complex ions (Figure 26.21). The charge on \\nthe complex ion [Fe(CN)6]4−(aq) is −4, and its sodium salt has the formula \\nNa4[Fe(CN)6](s). If Na4[Fe(CN)6](s) is dissolved in water, then the resulting \\nsolution contains the ions Na+(aq) and [Fe(CN)6]4−(aq)\\n\\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ 4 Na+(aq) + [Fe(CN)6]4–(aq)H2O(l)\\nNa4[Fe(CN)6](s)\\n\\nGenerally, a transition metal complex ion contains a central metal ion to \\nwhich are attached anions, neutral molecules, or some of each. As our example \\nof [Fe(CN)6]4−(aq) formation shows, a complex ion is a distinct chemical spe-\\ncies, with properties different from those of its constituents. The anions or neu-\\ntral molecules attached directly to the metal ion or atom are called ligands, \\nand the number of ligands that are attached to the central metal ion or atom is \\ncalled the coordination number. Transition metal complexes often are called \\ncoordination complexes to emphasize the bonding (i.e., the coordinations) of \\nthe ligands to the central metal ion or atom.\\n\\nThe sodium ions in the salt, Na4[Fe(CN)6](s), are called counter ions \\nbecause the positively charged sodium atoms counter (or balance) the negative \\ncharge of the transition metal complex. Note that counter ions are not ligands. \\nFor a soluble salt containing a transition metal complex, we can distinguish \\nbetween the ligands and the counter ions by observing what ions form upon \\ndissolution in water. For example, a soluble salt with the empirical formula \\nPtCl4(NH3)6(s) is found to dissociate in water according to the equation\\n\\n\\uf8e7\\uf8e7\\uf8e7→ [Pt(NH3)6]4+(aq) + 4 Cl–(aq)H2O(l)\\nPtCl4(NH3)6(s)\\n\\nFe2+\\n\\nCN–\\n\\n4–\\n\\nfigure 26.21 The complex ion \\n[Fe(CN)6]4− is octahedral, with the six \\ncyanide ions bonded to the central \\niron atom.

The CheMisTry of The TrAnsiTion MeTAls998\\n\\nThus, we see that [Pt(NH3)6]4+ is the formula of the transition metal complex \\nion and the four chloride ions in the empirical formula are counter ions. The \\nchemical formula for the salt is written correctly as [Pt(NH3)6]Cl4(s), where we \\nenclose the formula of the transition metal complex in brackets. As with other \\nsalts, we list cations first and anions second.\\n\\nTransition metal ions are capable of bonding to a wide variety of anions \\nand neutral molecules to form complex ions and neutral complexes (i.e., com-\\nplexes with zero net charge). For example, some transition metal ions in aque-\\nous solution form complex ions by bonding to water molecules. A Ni2+(aq) ion, \\nfor instance, forms the octahedral complex ion [Ni(H2O)6]2+(aq) in aqueous \\nsolution (Figure 26.22). A solution of nickel(II) perchlorate, Ni(ClO4)2(aq), is \\nbrilliant green because of the presence of the [Ni(H2O)6]2+(aq) complex ions. \\nIf NH3(aq) is added to the solution, the color changes from green to blue-violet \\n(Figure 26.23). The chemical reaction responsible for this color change involves \\na change in the ligands attached to the nickel(II) ion, as described by\\n\\n[Ni(H2O)6]2+(aq) + 6 NH3(aq) ⇌ [Ni(NH3)6]2+(aq) + 6 H2O(l )\\ngreen colorless blue-violet colorless\\n\\nThe H2O ligands attached to the nickel(II) ion are displaced by the NH3 mol-\\necules which then become the new ligands bonded to the nickel(II) ion. The \\ncomplex ion [Ni(NH3)6]2+ is octahedral like [Ni(H2O)6]2+, with NH3 molecules \\ninstead of H2O molecules surrounding the central nickel ion. A reaction involv-\\ning a change in the ligands bonded to the central metal ion in a complex ion is \\ncalled a ligand-substitution reaction.\\n\\nThe change in ligands from H2O to NH3 around nickel(II) produces a modi-\\nfied electrical environment around the nickel(II) ion that changes the energies \\nof the eight d electrons in the nickel(II) ion. This in turn causes a change in the \\nwavelength of the light absorbed by the ion and thus results in a color change. \\nIn general, light-induced electronic transitions of transition metal species give \\nrise to their color (Figure 26.23).\\n\\nNot all complex ions are octahedral. For example, if we add NaCN(aq) to a \\nsolution containing the blue-violet [Ni(NH3)6]2+(aq) complex ion, then cyanide \\nions displace the NH3 ligands from the nickel(II) ion to form the orange-yellow \\n[Ni(CN)4]2−(aq) complex ion (Figure 26.23).

Transition Metal Complexes have a systematic nomenclature\\nThe wide variety and large number of possible transition metal complexes make \\na systematic procedure for naming them essential. An example of a systematic \\nname for a compound that contains a transition metal complex ion is\\n\\n[Ni(NH3)6](NO3)2(s)  hexaamminenickel(II) nitrate\\n\\nLet’s analyze the name of this compound. As with any salt, the cation is named first. \\nThus, this name tells us that the compound consists of a hexaamminenickel(II) \\ncation and nitrate anions. The Greek prefix hexa- denotes six, and ammine - \\ndenotes the ligand NH3. Thus, the hexaammine - part of the name tells us that \\nthere are six NH3 ligands in the cation. The Roman numeral II tells us that the \\nnickel atom is in the +2 oxidation state. Because ammonia is a neutral molecule \\nand the nickel atom is in a +2 oxidation state, the charge on the complex cation \\nis +2. Its formula is [Ni(NH3)6]2+. This complex ion combines with two NO3– ions \\nto form a neutral salt, resulting in the formula given.\\n\\nA simplified set of nomenclature rules for naming transition metal com-\\nplexes is as follows:\\n\\n 1.

The CheMisTry of The TrAnsiTion MeTAls1008\\n\\nThe structures of transition metal complexes were worked out by the Swiss \\nchemist Alfred Werner (Frontispiece) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth \\ncenturies, without the aid of modern X-ray structure determination methods. \\nIn 1893, at the age of 26, he proposed a correct structural theory based on \\nthe number of different types of complexes, including isomers, that could be \\nprepared for platinum(II), platinum(IV), and cobalt(III) amminechloro com-\\nplexes. In 1913 Werner was awarded the Nobel Prize for his research in transi-\\ntion metal chemistry.\\n\\nThis section completes our introduction to the structure and nomenclature \\nof transition metal complexes. In the next section we turn to a consideration of \\ninteractions between the central metal ion d orbitals and the coordinated ligands. \\nWe shall show how the ligands perturb the various d orbitals in different ways, \\ndepending on the type and the spatial arrangement of the coordinated ligands.\\n\\n26-11.  The five d orbitals of a Transition Metal ion in an octahedral \\nComplex Are split into Two Groups by the ligands\\n\\nThe five d  orbitals (Figure 26.20) in a gas-phase transition metal atom or ion \\nwithout any attached ligands all have the same energy. However, when six iden-\\ntical ligands are attached to the transition metal ion to form an octahedral \\ncomplex, the d orbitals on the metal ion are split into two sets, each set with a \\ndifferent energy (Figure 26.33). This outcome is called d-orbital splitting.\\n\\nThe difference in the energies of the two sets of d  orbitals means that a \\nd  electron can make a transition from one set of orbitals to the other by absorb-\\ning light. We shall show that this absorption of light by electrons in the d  orbitals \\naccounts for the colors of many coordination compounds. The lower-energy set \\nof orbitals, called t2g orbitals, consists of three orbitals (dxy, dxz, and dyz), and the \\nhigher-energy set of orbitals, called eg orbitals, consists of two orbitals (dx2−y2 and \\ndz2). (The designation t2g and eg may seem a bit mysterious to you. The origin of \\nthe notation lies in the mathematical theory of the symmetry of these species, \\nand is really of no concern to us here.) The magnitude of the splitting of the \\nd orbitals depends on both the central metal ion and the ligands. We shall let Do \\n(where the subscript o stands for octahedral) be the energy difference between \\nthe t2g and eg orbitals. The t2g orbitals can accommodate up to six electrons, and \\nthe eg orbitals can accommodate up to four electrons.\\n\\nThe splitting of the d orbitals in an octahedral complex can be explained \\nusing an electrostatic model called crystal field theory. Consider the octa hedral \\n\\ndxy\\n_\\n\\ndxz\\n_\\n\\ndx2–y2\\n_\\n\\ndz2\\n_\\n\\ndyz\\n_ t2g\\n\\nML6(g)M(g)\\n\\ndxy\\n_\\n\\ndxz\\n_\\n\\ndx2–y2\\n_\\n\\ndz2\\n_\\n\\ndyz\\n_\\n\\neg ∆o\\n\\nfigure 26.33 d-orbital splitting pattern \\nfor a regular octahedral complex, \\nwhere M stands for the metal atom \\nand L for the ligand.\\n\\n\\n\\n1009\\n\\ncomplex shown in Figure 26.34, where the ligands are located along the posi-\\ntive and negative x, y, and z axes. Each ligand possesses a lone pair of electrons \\nthat for the moment can be considered to be localized on its ligating atom and \\ndirected toward the transition metal atom. Note that the dz2 and dx2−y2 orbitals \\n(the eg set) point directly toward these ligand lone pairs, whereas the dxy, dxz, and \\ndyz orbitals (the t2g set) point between the ligand lone pairs. An electron placed \\nin a dz2 or a dx2−y2 orbital will, therefore, experience a greater electrostatic repul-\\nsion (like charges repel) than one placed in a dxy, dxz, or dyz orbital because the eg \\nelectron will have a higher  probability of being close to the ligand lone-pair elec-\\ntrons. Thus, electrons in the eg set of orbitals will have a higher energy than those \\nin the t2g set. The d-orbital splitting pattern in an octahedral complex is thus \\nseen to be a consequence of the positions of the ligands relative to the d orbitals.\\n\\nTo determine the ground state d-orbital configuration of a transition metal \\nin a complex, we place electrons in the t2g and eg orbitals in a manner similar to \\nthat used in Chapter 5 for the electrons in atoms. Here also we must observe \\nthe restrictions of the Pauli exclusion principle (Section 5-6) and Hund’s rule \\n(Section 5-8). Thus, the orbitals of lower energy (the t2g set) are occupied first, \\nand as these orbitals are all of the same energy, each one must contain one \\nelectron before any one can contain two electrons. For example, an octahedral \\nCr(III) complex has three d electrons; and the d electron configuration would \\nbe t 32ge0g (Figure 26.35). Note that Hund’s rule requires that each t2g orbital con-\\ntain one electron and that all have the same spin.\\n\\nFor an octahedral Ni(II) complex with eight d electrons, we can accommo-\\ndate six of these eight electrons in the t2g orbitals (spins paired). The remaining \\ntwo electrons must occupy the higher-energy set (the eg orbitals), giving the con-\\nfiguration t 62ge 2g (Figure 26.36). By Hund’s rule the two eg orbitals have one elec-\\n\\n26-11.

For most \\ncases, the value of the energy difference, Do (also called the octahedral splitting \\nenergy), corresponds to the values of photon energies in the visible region of \\nthe electromagnetic spectrum. In other words, the frequency of the radiation \\nthat is absorbed, which obeys the relation\\n\\nE = hn = Do\\n\\nis often in the visible region of the spectrum. Thus, many transition metal com-\\nplexes absorb light in the visible region as a result of d-electron transitions and \\nare colored (Figure 26.37).\\n\\nIt is possible to understand the variety of colors of octahedral complex ions \\nin terms of the magnitudes of Do values and the electron occupancy of the t2g \\nand eg orbitals. For example, consider the purple [Ti(H2O)6]3+(aq) complex ion \\n(Figure 26.38).

Unpaired electrons act like tiny magnets \\nas a result of their intrinsic spin. Molecules with unpaired electrons can be \\nmagnetized by an external field and are called paramagnetic. As we showed for \\noxygen in Section 9-4, paramagnetic molecules line up in an external magnetic \\nfield with the electron spins parallel to the applied field. Thus, a paramagnetic \\nsubstance behaves like a collection of magnets and is drawn into an externally \\napplied magnetic field (Figure 26.42). In contrast, the magnetic fields from \\npaired electrons, which have opposite spins, cancel out. Therefore, molecules \\nwith no unpaired electrons cannot be magnetized (in fact, they are repelled) by \\nan external magnetic field and are called diamagnetic. Because a diamagnetic \\nsubstance is not drawn into an applied magnetic field, it is easily distinguished \\nfrom a paramagnetic substance. In some cases it is possible to determine the \\nnumber of unpaired electrons by measuring the force with which the paramag-\\nnetic substance is drawn into the magnetic field.\\n\\nMagnetic experiments have shown that the compound K4[Fe(CN)6](s) is \\ndiamagnetic, whereas the compound K4[FeF6](s) is paramagnetic. Furthermore, \\nthere are four unpaired electrons in the [FeF6]4− complex ion. We can explain \\nthese observations in terms of d-orbital electron configurations. Let’s consider \\nthe [FeF6]4− complex ion. Iron(II) has six d electrons, and, as noted in the pre-\\nvious section, d6 systems have two possible d-electron configurations. The two \\npossibilities for the d-electron configuration of an octahedral iron(II) complex \\nion are shown below:\\n\\nt62g\\n\\n(low spin)\\n\\ndxy\\n↑↓_\\n\\ndxz\\n↑↓_\\n\\ndx2–y2\\n_\\n\\ndz2\\n_\\n\\ndyz\\n↑↓_\\n\\ne0g\\n∆o\\n\\nt42g\\n\\n(high spin)\\n\\ndxy\\n↑↓_\\n\\ndxz\\n↑_\\n\\ndx2–y2 dz2\\n↑_↑_\\n\\ndyz\\n↑_\\n\\ne2g∆o\\n\\n \\n\\nIn one case the d-electron configuration is t 62ge0g, and in the other case it is t 42ge2g. In \\nthe t 62ge0g configuration, the spins of all the electrons are paired; in the t 42ge2g con-\\nfiguration, the electrons are in different orbitals with four unpaired electrons, \\nin accord with Hund’s rule. The t 62ge0g configuration is said to be a low-spin con-\\nfiguration, and the t 42ge2g configuration is said to be a high-spin configuration.\\n\\nThe value of Do determines whether a d-electron configuration is low spin or \\nhigh spin. If Do is large, then the d electrons fill the t2g orbitals completely before \\noccupying the higher-energy eg orbitals. If Do is small, then the d electrons occupy \\nthe eg orbitals before they pair up in the t2g orbitals. For example, the d6 complex \\nion, [Fe(CN)6]4, is low spin and has no unpaired electrons (Figure 26.43a). This \\nconfiguration occurs because Do is large relative to the electron-pairing energy, \\nthe energy required to pair up the electrons in the t2g orbitals.

The CheMisTry of The TrAnsiTion MeTAls1014\\n\\nrequires less energy to pair up two more electrons in the t2g orbitals in [Fe(CN)6]4−\\n\\nthan to place the two electrons in the high-energy (large Do) eg orbitals. The d6\\n\\ncomplex ion, [FeF6]4−, on the other hand, is high spin and has four unpaired elec-\\ntrons (Figure 26.43b). This configuration occurs because Do is small relative to \\nthe energy required to pair up the electrons in the t2g orbitals. Thus, we see that \\n[Fe(CN)6]4− is diamagnetic, with no unpaired electrons, and that [FeF6]4− is para-\\nmagnetic, with four unpaired electrons. The Do values obtained from the spectra \\nof the complexes show that the CN− ligands interact much more strongly with \\niron(II) than do the F− ligands; that is, Do(CN−) >> Do(F–). The increased d-orbital \\nsplitting energy for CN− ligand is sufficiently great to overcome the additional \\nelectron-electron repulsions that result from pairing up the electrons. A low-spin \\ncomplex results whenever the energy difference between the t2g and eg orbitals is \\ngreater than the electron-pairing energy.\\n\\nAs we saw in the previous section, for d1, d 2, and d3 and d 8, d 9, and d10 octa-\\nhedral complexes there is only one possible arrangement of the electrons in the \\nground state configuration. However, as we have just seen, for d4, d 5, d6, and d7 \\noctahedral complexes there are two possible d-electron configurations: a high-\\nspin configuration and a low-spin configuration. The high-spin and low-spin \\nd-electron configurations of these ions are shown in Figure 26.44. The high-spin \\nconfiguration has the maximum possible number of unpaired d electrons and \\nthe low-spin configuration has the minimum possible number of unpaired d \\nelectrons.\\n\\nexAMPle 26-9: Give the d electron configuration of the low-spin complex \\n[Pt(NH3)6]4+(aq).\\n\\nSolution: Referring to Figure 26.1, we see that platinum is the eighth member \\nof the 5d transition series. Therefore, platinum(II) is a d8 ion. The platinum \\nion in the [Pt(NH3)6]4+(aq) complex ion is platinum(IV). Platinum(IV) is a \\nd6 ion because it has two fewer d electrons than platinum(II). The d-electron \\nconfiguration of a low-spin d6 ion is t62ge0g (Figure 26.44). The complex ion is \\ndiamagnetic because it has no unpaired electrons.\\n\\nPrACTiCe ProBleM 26-9: Predict which of the following ions can \\nform both low-spin and high-spin complexes depending on the ligands: \\n(a) Cr(III); (b) Mn(II); (c) Cu(III).\\n\\nAnswer: (b) Mn(II)\\n\\nt42g\\n\\ndxy\\n↑↓_\\n\\ndxz\\n↑_\\n\\ndx2–y2 dz2\\n↑_↑_\\n\\ndyz\\n↑_\\n\\ne2g ∆o (F–) < pairing energy\\n\\n(b) [FeF6]4\\n– (high spin, paramagnetic)(a) [Fe(CN)6]4\\n\\n– (low spin, diamagnetic)\\n\\nt62g\\n\\ndxy\\n↑↓_\\n\\ndxz\\n↑↓_\\n\\ndx2–y2\\n_\\n\\ndz2\\n_\\n\\ndyz\\n↑↓_\\n\\ne0g ∆o  (CN–) > pairing energy\\n\\nfigure 26.43 (a) A low-spin octahedral \\ncomplex results when Do is greater \\nthan the pairing energy.

The arrangement of \\nligands in order of increasing ability to split d orbitals on the central transition \\nmetal atom is shown in Figure 26.45. This list is called the Fajans-Tsuchida \\nspectro chemical series in honor of two pioneers in the spectroscopic studies \\nof transition metal complexes. The most important thing to observe from the \\nseries is that metal-halide complexes are always high spin and that metal-cyanide \\ncomplexes and most metal-carbonyl complexes are low spin. The splitting due to \\nthe other ligands can be either low spin or high spin, depending on the oxida-\\ntion state of the transition metal and whether it is a 3d, 4d, or 5d transition metal.\\n\\nexAMPle 26-10: Predict the number of unpaired electrons in (a) the \\nhexachlorochromate(II) complex ion and (b) the hexacyanocobaltate(III) \\ncomplex ion.\\n\\nSolution: (a) The chemical formula of the complex ion is [CrCl6]4−. \\nChromium(II) is a d4 ion, and according to Figure 26.45 the value of Do for \\na Cl− ligand is relatively small. Thus, we predict that [CrCl6]4− is a high-spin \\ncomplex (t 32ge1g) with four unpaired electrons. (b) The chemical formula \\nof the complex ion is [Co(CN)6]3–. Cobalt(III) is a d6 ion, and according \\nto Figure 26.45 the value of Do is relatively large. Thus, we predict that \\n[Co(CN)6]3– is a low-spin complex (t 62ge0g) with no unpaired electrons.\\n\\nPrACTiCe ProBleM 26-10: For the following two salts, predict the \\nground state d-electron configurations and whether each is paramagnetic \\nor diamagnetic: (a) K3[Fe(CN)6](s); (b) K2Na[Co(NO2)6](s).\\n\\nAnswer: (a) t 52ge0g, paramagnetic; (b) t 62ge0g, diamagnetic\\n\\nThe ligands OH–, H2O, and NH3 give rise to Do values for  M(II) 3d ions \\nthat are roughly equal to the pairing energy; thus, some complexes containing \\nthese ligands are high spin and some are low spin. For a given metal and ligand, \\nthe value of Do increases as the oxidation state of the metal increases because \\nthe higher ionic charge leads to a greater electrostatic interaction between the \\nmetal and the ligand.

The CheMisTry of The TrAnsiTion MeTAls1016\\n\\nions show that the value of Do increases as we go from the 3d to the 4d to the 5d \\ntransition series for a particular number of d electrons. These trends are illus-\\ntrated by the data given in Table 26.13. The magnitude of Do values is such that, \\nwith the exception of metal-halide (F−, Cl−, Br−, I−) complexes, all ions of the \\n4d and 5d transition metal series in M(III) and higher oxidation states are low \\nspin. Also, as shown in Figure 26.45, all NO2−, CN−, and CO complexes are \\nlow spin. The orbitals of square planar and tetrahedral complexes are also split \\nin the presence of ligands. If you pursue your studies in chemistry, you will \\nlearn about these splittings and many other aspects of the rich and fascinating \\nchemistry of the transition metals in a course on inorganic chemistry.\\n\\nsuMMAry\\nThere are three d-block transition metal series (3d, 4d, and 5d), each having \\n10 members. A transition metal ion with x d electrons is called a dx ion. The \\nkeys to understanding the chemistry of the d-block transition metal series are \\nthe electron occupancy of the five d orbitals of the metal ion and the influ-\\nence of the ligands on the relative energies and splitting patterns of the orbit-\\nals. Ligands are anions or neutral molecules that bind to metal ions or neutral \\nmetal atoms to form distinct chemical species called complexes, complex ions, \\nor neutral complexes. Chelating or polydentate ligands are ligands that attach \\nto two or more coordination positions on the metal. \\n\\nThe geometry of a complex with identical ligands may be octahedral (the \\nmost common), tetrahedral, square planar, or linear. The d-orbital splitting \\npattern is different for each geometry. The determining factor of the splitting \\nof the d orbitals is the placement of the ligands in the complex relative to the \\npositions of the d orbitals. The splitting of the d orbitals gives rise to the pos-\\nsibility of low-spin and high-spin complexes for octahedral d 4, d 5, d 6, and d7\\n\\nions. The d-orbital splittings are denoted as Do. A paramagnetic complex ion \\nhas unpaired electrons. Magnetic measurements can be used to detect the pres-\\nence of unpaired electrons in a complex. Certain octahedral and square planar \\ncomplexes exist as cis and trans isomers. Some complexes also exhibit optical \\nisomerization.\\n\\nTABle 26.13 octahedral splitting energy (Do) values for various transition metal \\ncomplexes\\n\\nComplex DO/kJ∙mol−1 Observations\\n\\n[Co(NH3)6]2+\\n\\n[Co(NH3)6]3+\\n\\n[Rh(NH3)6]3+\\n\\n[Ir(NH3)6]3+\\n\\n121\\n\\n274\\n\\n408\\n\\n478\\n\\n \\nDO increases with increasing oxidation states of cobalt\\n\\nDO increases as we move down a column in the \\nperiodic table for a given oxidation state\\n\\n\\n\\nProBleMs 1017\\n\\nTerMs you should knoW\\n\\nd-block elements 980\\nchromous bubbler 985\\nautocatalytic 985\\ncoke 987\\nblast furnace 987\\nbasic oxygen process 988\\nmild steel 988\\nmedium steel 988\\nhigh-carbon steel 989\\nstainless steel 989\\nbrass 991\\nbronze 991\\ndxy, dxz, dyz, dx2−y2, dz2 orbitals 995\\ndx ion 995\\ncomplex ion 997\\n\\nligand 997\\ncoordination number 997\\ncoordination complex 997\\ncounter ion 997\\nneutral complex 998\\nligand-substitution reaction 998\\ncoordination position 1003\\nligating atoms 1003\\npolydentate ligand 1003\\nchelating ligand 1003\\nchelate 1003\\nbidentate 1003\\ntridentate 1003\\ncis and trans isomers 1005\\ngeometric isomers 1005\\n\\noptical isomerism 1007\\nchirality 1007\\noptical isomers 1007\\nd-orbital splitting 1008\\nt2g and eg orbitals 1008\\ncrystal field theory 1008\\noctahedral splitting energy, Do 1010\\nparamagnetic 1013\\ndiamagnetic 1013\\nlow-spin configuration 1013\\nhigh-spin configuration 1013\\nelectron-pairing energy 1013\\nFajans-Tsuchida spectrochemical \\n\\nseries 1015\\n\\nProBleMs\\n\\nTrAnsiTion MeTAl CheMisTry\\n\\n26-1.

We were very conscious of \\nthe difficulty some institutions face in altering published course descriptions. \\nTherefore, while arranging the chapters in this text, we intentionally kept the \\nmajor topics presented in the first and second halves of the book unaltered. \\n\\nSome concerns naturally arise over the coordination of lectures and labora-\\ntories as a result of the fact that the mole concept and chemical calculations are \\nnot introduced until Chapter 11. In fact, a review of most first-semester chem-\\nistry laboratory experiments reveals that roughly half of these do not require \\nstoichiometric calculations. In most cases a simple rearrangement of existing \\nlaboratory experiments is all that is required to coordinate with an atoms-first \\napproach. \\n\\nWe have provided a sample course syllabus and laboratory schedule on \\nour website at www.mcquarriegeneralchemistry.com/sample_syllabus.pdf that \\nshows a hypothetical pairing of laboratories and lectures for our text. Here we \\npresent experiments on measurements, separations, periodic properties, spec-\\ntroscopy, and chemical structure prior to experiments requiring stoichiomet-\\nric calculations. In this way student experiments develop from fundamental \\nprinciples to chemical calculations in a manner that mirrors the text. The only \\nexperiment where moles and molarity might be deemed essential is the spectro-\\nscopic determination of concentration. However, even this can be performed \\nby presenting concentration in units of milligrams per milliliter rather than \\nmolarity. \\n\\nFor instructors whose laboratory program requires the early introduction of \\nmoles and molarity, the material in Sections 11-1 and 11-2 on the mole concept \\nand Sections 12-1 and 12-2 on solutions and molarity may easily be introduced \\nat the end of Chapter 1 as a continuation of the discussion of chemical measure-\\nment. This minor rearrangement may be accomplished without loss of continu-\\nity in order to support the use of these units in the laboratory.\\n\\nThus, although the atoms-first approach may require some minor adjust-\\nments to the course syllabus and laboratory schedule, often a simple rearrange-\\nment of existing experiments will prove sufficient to enjoy the pedagogical ad-\\nvantages of what we believe to be a more logical approach to teaching chemistry. \\n\\nFor those who wish to go beyond the printed text, this book also features \\na complimentary selection of online Interchapters. These explore supplemen-\\ntal topics such as Sources of Energy, Polymers, Nuclear Chemistry, Descriptive \\nChemistry, Biochemistry, and Organic Chemistry. Because these are online and \\neasily accessible, they are flexible and easy to assign, while keeping the printed \\nbook slim and affordable. Moreover, they contain some of the most beauti- \\nful color images in the text! Not to be missed, the Interchapters are online at:  \\nwww.McQuarrieGeneralChemistry.com. \\n\\nWe welcome your comments, questions, and feedback regarding this new \\nedition of General Chemistry!\\n\\nEthan B.

Scientific Notation and Exponents\\nThe numbers encountered in chemistry are often extremely large (such as \\n8 180 000 000) or extremely small (such as 0.000 004 613). When working with \\nsuch numbers, it is convenient to express them in scientific notation, where we \\nwrite the number as a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by 10 raised to the \\nappropriate power. For example, the number 171.3 is 1.713 × 100 = 1.713 × 102 in \\nscientific notation. Some other examples are\\n\\n 7320 = 7.32 × 103\\n 1 623 000 = 1.623 × 106\\n\\nBecause the zeros in these numbers serve as placeholders only, they are not \\nregarded as significant figures and are dropped in scientific notation. Notice \\nthat in each case the power of 10 is the number of places that the decimal point \\nhas been moved to the left:\\n\\n7 320.\\n3 places 6 places\\n\\n1 623 000.\\n\\nWhen numbers that are smaller than 1 are expressed in scientific notation, \\nthe 10 is raised to a negative power. For example, 0.614 becomes 6.14 × 10–1. \\nRecall that a negative exponent is governed by the relation\\n\\n \\n1\\n\\n—\\n10n\\n\\n10–n =  (A1.1)\\n\\nSome other examples are\\n\\n 0.0005 = 5 × 10–4\\n 0.000 000 000 446 = 4.46 × 10–10\\n\\nNotice that the power of 10 in each case is the number of places that the deci-\\nmal point has been moved to the right:\\n\\n0.0005\\n\\n4 places 10 places\\n\\n0.000 000 000 446\\n\\nWhen performing chemical calculations, it is necessary to be able to work \\nwith numbers in scientific notation.\\n\\nTo add or subtract two or more numbers expressed in scientific notation, \\nthe power of 10 must be the same in both. For example, consider the sum\\n\\n5.127 × 104 + 1.073 × 103\\n\\nIt is good practice always to include \\na zero before a leading decimal point \\nso that the decimal point does not get \\noverlooked. For example, you should \\nwrite 0.345 instead of just .345. You \\ncan see here that the zero nicely alerts \\nyou to the presence of the following \\ndecimal point.\\n\\nOne of the best time investments that \\nyou can make is to become proficient \\nin using your calculator, not only \\nfor general chemistry but for other \\ncourses that you will take. Reworking \\nthe examples in this Appendix using \\nyour calculator is a good way to test \\nyour proficiency in working with \\nnumbers in scientific notation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX AA-2\\n\\nWe rewrite the first number as\\n\\n5.127 × 104 = 51.27 × 103\\n\\nNote that we have changed the 104 factor to 103, so we must make the factor in \\nfront of 103 one power of 10 larger. Thus, we have\\n\\n5.127 × 104 + 1.073 × 103  = (51.27 + 1.073) × 103\\n\\n= 52.34 × 103 = 5.234 × 104\\n\\nTo change a number such as 52.34 × 103 to 5.234 × 104, we make the number \\nin front one factor of 10 smaller; so we must make 103 one factor of 10 larger. \\nSimilarly, we have\\n\\n(4.708 × 10–6) – (2.1 × 10–8)  = (4.708 – 0.021) × 10–6\\n\\n= 4.687 × 10–6\\n\\nIn changing 2.1 × 10–8 to 0.021 × 10–6, we make 2.1 two factors of 10 (or 10 × 10 = \\n100 times) smaller and 10–8 two factors of 10 (or 100 times) larger.\\n\\nWhen multiplying two numbers, we add the powers of 10 because of the \\nrelation\\n\\n (10x)(10y) = 10x\\u2009+ y (A1.2)\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\n(5.00 × 102)(4.00 × 103)  = (5.00)(4.00) × 102+3\\n\\n= 20.0 × 105 = 2.00 × 106\\n\\nand\\n\\n(3.014 × 103)(8.217 × 10–6)  = (3.014)(8.217) × 103–6\\n\\n= 24.77 × 10–3 = 2.477 × 10–2\\n\\nTo divide, we subtract the power of 10 of the number in the denominator \\nfrom the power of 10 of the number in the numerator because of the relation\\n\\n \\n10x\\n—\\n10y\\n\\n= 10x–y (A1.3)\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\n=\\n\\n= 0.50 × 10–11 = 5.0 × 10–12\\n\\n4.0\\n—\\n8.0\\n\\n4.0 × 1012\\n—\\n8.0 × 1023\\n\\n× 1012–23� �\\n\\nand\\n\\n=\\n\\n= 0.592 × 101 = 5.92\\n\\n2.80\\n—\\n4.73\\n\\n2.80 × 10–4\\n—\\n4.73 × 10–5\\n\\n× 10–4+5� �\\n\\n\\n\\nA MAthEMAtIcAl REvIEw A-3\\n\\nTo raise a number to a power, we use the fact that\\n\\n (10x)n = 10nx (A1.4)\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\n(2.187 × 102)3  = (2.187)3 × 103×2\\n\\n= 10.46 × 106 = 1.046 × 107\\n\\nTo take a root of a number, we use the relation\\n\\n \\nn\\n\\n��10x = (10x)1 ⁄n = 10x ⁄n (A1.5)\\n\\nThus, the power of 10 must be expressed such that it is divisible by the root. For \\nexample,\\n\\n3�����2.70 × 1010 = (2.70 × 1010)1 ⁄ 3 = (27.0 × 109)1 ⁄ 3\\n\\n= (27.0)1 ⁄ 3 × 109 ⁄ 3 = 3.00 × 103\\n\\nand\\n\\n�����6.40 × 105 = (6.40 × 105)1 ⁄ 2 = (64.0 × 104)1 ⁄ 2\\n\\n= (64.0)1 ⁄ 2 × 104 ⁄ 2 = 8.00 × 102\\n\\nToday you can easily do all such operations using a handheld calculator or a \\ncomputer. However, you should also be proficient at carrying out such calculations \\nby hand because a quick estimate of the “order of magnitude” of a desired result \\noften serves as a good check that the operations were carried out correctly.\\n\\nA2. common logarithms\\nYou know that 100 = 102, 1000 = 103, and so on. You also might know that\\n\\n��10 = 101 ⁄ 2 = 100.500 = 3.16\\n\\n(where we have rounded off the answer to two decimal places).\\nBy taking the square root of both sides of\\n\\n100.500 = 3.16\\n\\nwe find that\\n\\n���100.500 = 10(1 ⁄ 2)0.500 = 100.250 = ��3.16 = 1.78\\n\\nFurthermore, because\\n\\n(10x)(10y) = 10x\\u2009+ y\\n\\nwe can write\\n\\n100.250 × 100.500 = 100.750 = (3.16)(1.78) = 5.62\\n\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX AA-4\\n\\nBy continuing this process, we can express any number y as\\n\\n y = 10x (A2.1)\\n\\nThe number x to which 10 must be raised to get y is called the logarithm of y \\nand is written as\\n\\n x = log y (A2.2)\\n\\nWe say that Equations A2.1 and A2.2 are the inverse of each other. Because \\n100 = 1, we have log 1 = 0. Thus far, then, we’ve shown that\\n\\n log 1.00 = 0.000 \\n log 1.78 = 0.250 \\n log 3.16 = 0.500 \\n log 5.62 = 0.750 \\n log 10.00 = 1.0000\\n\\nThe last entry here follows from the fact that 10 = 101. We could go on like this \\nand build up a complete table of common logarithms, but this has already been \\ndone for us. Not only are there extensive tables of logarithms, but any scientific \\ncalculator has a log key.\\n\\nBecause logarithms are exponents (y = 10x), they have certain special prop-\\nerties, such as\\n\\n log xy = log x + log y (A2.3)\\n\\n x—\\ny = log x  – log y log\\n\\n (A2.4)\\n\\n log xn = n log x (A2.5)\\n\\n log log x ��x = log x1 ⁄n = \\nn 1\\n\\n—\\nn  (A2.6)\\n\\nIf we let x = 1 in Equation A2.4, then we have\\n\\n1\\n—\\ny = log(1) – log y  = –log y log\\n\\nor\\n\\n 1—\\ny = –log y log\\n\\n (A2.7)\\n\\nThus, we change the sign of a logarithm when we take the reciprocal of its \\nargument.\\n\\nwhen taking a logarithm, x = log y, \\nthe number of decimal places in x is \\nequal to the number of significant \\nfigures in y. So, for example,\\n\\n23.780 = log 6.02 × 1023\\n3 decimal   3 significant \\nplaces  figures\\n\\nYou should try to verify these \\nequations for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\nA MAthEMAtIcAl REvIEw A-5\\n\\nLet’s go back to Equation A2.1, y  = 10x . If x  = 0, then y  = 1. Therefore, if \\nx ≥ 0, then y  ≥ 1; and if x  ≤ 0, then y  ≤ 1, or\\n\\n log y  ≥ 0  if y  ≥ 1 \\n(A2.8)\\n\\nlog y  ≤ 0  if y  ≤ 1\\n\\nFigure A.1 shows a plot of log y against y illustrating these relationships.\\nOne property of logarithms that you may not have encountered before is \\n\\nthat you cannot take the logarithm of a quantity that has units. You can take \\nthe logarithms only of numbers. It makes no sense to ask what the logarithm of \\n2.43 grams is. You can take the logarithm of 2.43, but not of 2.43 grams. Neither \\nx nor y can have units in Equation A2.1.\\n\\nUp to this point we have found the value of x in y = 10x when y is given. It \\nis often necessary to find the value of y when x is given. Because x is called the \\nlogarithm of y, y is called the antilogarithm, or inverse logarithm, of x. For \\nexample, the antilogarithm of x = 2 is y = 100. Less obvious is that the antiloga-\\nrithm of x = 6.0969 is 1.250 × 106. You can get this last result using your hand \\ncalculator. Different calculators have different ways of finding antilogarithms, \\nso you should practice this on your own calculator.\\n\\nA3. Natural logarithms\\nThe logarithms that we have just discussed in the previous section are called \\ncommon logarithms, or logarithms to the base 10 because we start with \\nEquation A2.1, y = 10x, to define x = log y. In fact, some authors use the notation \\nx = log10 y to emphasize the base 10. The definition of pH, the Richter earth-\\nquake scale, and the decibel sound scale, among others, are expressed in terms \\nof common logarithms. Logarithms to another base arise naturally in calculus. \\nThe base is a number called e, where\\n\\n e  = 2.718 281 828 46… (A3.1)\\n\\nThe logarithms to this base, called natural logarithms, are designated by ln \\ninstead of log. Thus, we have\\n\\n x = ln y (A3.2)\\n\\nand its inverse\\n\\n y = ex (A3.3)\\n\\nEven if you have not taken a course in calculus, you needn’t worry: the func-\\ntions ln y and ex are on all scientific calculators. For example, you can use your \\ncalculator to show that\\n\\ne 2 = 7.389 056…\\n\\nand\\n\\ne –2 = 0.135 335…\\n\\nIo\\ng \\n\\ny\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\ny\\n1 5 10\\n\\nFigure A.1 The common logarithm of \\ny plotted against y. Notice that log y \\ntakes on positive values for y greater \\nthan one and negative values for y less \\nthan one. The curve increases rather \\nslowly for increasing y and decreases \\nrather quickly for small values of y. It \\npasses through the horizontal axis at  \\ny = 1 because log 1 = 0.\\n\\nwhen taking an antilogarithm, y = 10x, \\nthe number of significant figures in y is \\nequal to the number of decimal places \\nin x. So, for example,\\n8.79 × 10–18 = 10–17.056\\n3 significant 3 decimal\\nfigures places\\n\\nthe rules for determining the number \\nof significant figures for natural \\nlogarithms are the same as those for \\ncommon logarithms.\\n\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX AA-6\\n\\nNote that e –2 = 1/e2, as you might expect. In fact, the mathematical properties of \\nex and natural logarithms are similar to those of 10x and log y. For example,\\n\\n ln xy = ln x  + ln y (A3.4)\\n\\n x—\\ny = ln x  – ln y ln\\n\\n (A3.5)\\n\\n ln xn = n ln x (A3.6)\\n\\n ln ln x ��x = ln x1 ⁄n = \\nn 1\\n\\n—\\nn  (A3.7)\\n\\nBecause e = e1, we see that ln e = 1, just as log10 10 = 1. Because e 0 = 1, we have \\nln 1 = 0 and\\n\\n ln y  ≥ 0  if y  ≥ 1 \\n(A3.8)\\n\\nln y  ≤ 0  if y  ≤ 1\\n\\njust as in the case of common logarithms (Equations A2.8).

We will take a few lines to derive the relation between ln y and log y. We \\nstart with y = 10x (Equation A2.1) and write 10 = ea (we’ll determine the value of \\na shortly), so that we have\\n\\ny  = 10x = (ea)x = eax\\n\\nNow take log and ln of this equation to write\\n\\nlog y  = x log 10 = x\\n\\nand\\n\\nln y  = ax  ln e  = ax\\n\\nIn\\n y\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\ne\\ny\\n\\ne25 101\\n\\nFigure A.2 The natural logarithm of y \\nplotted against y.

For example, let’s \\nfind the solutions to the quadratic equation\\n\\n2x2 – 3x – 1 = 0\\n\\nIn this case, a  = 2, b  = –3, and c  = –1 and Equation A4.2 gives\\n\\n3 ±     (–3)2 – (4)(2)(–1)\\n—\\n\\n2(2)\\nx =\\n\\n�������\\n\\n3 ± 4.123\\n—\\n\\n4\\n=\\n\\n= 1.781    and    –0.281\\n\\nNote that you get two solutions to a quadratic equation. To use the quadratic \\nformula, it is first necessary to put the quadratic equation in the standard form \\nso that we know the values of the constants a, b, and c. For example, consider the \\nproblem of solving for x in the quadratic equation\\n\\nx2\\n—\\n0.50 – x\\n\\n= 0.040\\n\\nTo identify the constants a, b, and c, we must write this equation in the standard \\nquadratic form. Multiplying both sides by 0.50 – x  yields\\n\\nx2  = (0.50 – x)(0.040) = 0.020 – 0.040x\\n\\nDo you remember how to derive this \\nequation? try completing the square \\nof Equation A4.1.\\n\\n\\n\\nA MAthEMAtIcAl REvIEw A-9\\n\\nRearrangement to the standard quadratic form yields\\n\\nx2 + 0.040x – 0.020 = 0\\n\\nThus, a = 1, b = 0.040, and c = –0.020.

Successive Approximations\\nMany problems involving chemical equilibria lead to a quadratic equation of \\nthe form\\n\\n \\nx2\\n\\n—\\nM0 – x\\n\\n= K  (A5.1)\\n\\nwhere x is the concentration of a particular species, M0 is an initial concentra-\\ntion, and K is often a small constant. For example, the equation\\n\\n [A]\\n2\\n\\n—\\n0.100 M – [A]\\n\\n= 6.25 × 10–5 M (A5.2)\\n\\nis the equation for the concentration of species A in a certain solution (the \\nsquare brackets around A denote concentration). If the value of K is small \\n(which it is in this case), then it is more convenient to solve an equation like \\nEquation A5.1 by the method of successive approximations than by using the \\nquadratic equation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX AA-10\\n\\nThe first step in the method of successive approximations is to neglect the \\nunknown in the denominator on the left-hand side of Equation A5.2. This \\napproximation allows the unknown to be found by simply multiplying through \\nby the initial concentration and taking the square root of both sides. Making \\nthis approximation in Equation A5.2 yields\\n\\n [A]1 ≈ [(0.100 M)(6.25 × 10–5 M)]1 ⁄ 2 = 2.50 × 10–3 M (A5.3)\\n\\nWe have subscripted [A] with a 1 in this result because it represents a first \\napproximation to the value of [A]. To obtain a second approximation, we use \\nthis value of [A]1 in the denominator of the left-hand side of Equation A5.2, \\nmultiply both sides by the result in the denominator, and then take the square \\nroot:\\n\\n[A]2 ≈ [(0.100 M – 2.50 × 10–3 M)(6.25 × 10–5 M)]1 ⁄ 2 = 2.47 × 10–3 M\\n\\nWe now carry out the cycle, called an iteration, again to obtain a third \\napproximation:\\n\\n[A]3 ≈ [(0.100 M – 2.47 × 10–3 M)(6.25 × 10–5 M)]1 ⁄ 2 = 2.47 × 10–3 M\\n\\nObserve that [A]3 ≈ [A]2. When this occurs, we say that the procedure has \\nconverged. After convergence is achieved, the same result will occur in any sub-\\nsequent iteration, and the value obtained is the solution to the original equation \\nbecause the equation is satisfied by the same value of [A] in the numerator as \\nin the denominator.\\n\\nThe method of successive approximations is particularly convenient for rap-\\nidly solving a quadratic equation using a hand calculator. While it is usually \\nnecessary to carry out several iterations to obtain the solution, each cycle is easy \\nto perform on a calculator, and the total effort involved usually is less than that \\nof using the quadratic formula.\\n\\nUsually, you will obtain convergence after only a few iterations. If you don’t \\nsee the successive iterations approaching some value after just a few iterations, \\nthen probably it is better to use the quadratic formula.\\n\\nHere are some examples to practice with:\\n\\n1.\\nx2\\n\\n—\\n0.500 – x\\n\\n= 1.07 × 10–3 (x1 = 2.31 × 10–2, x2 = 2.26 × 10–2, x3 = 2.26 × 10–2)\\n\\n2.\\nx2\\n\\n—\\n0.0100 – x\\n\\n= 6.80 × 10–4\\n(x1 = 2.61 × 10–3, x2 = 2.24 × 10–3, x3 = 2.30 × 10–3, \\nx4 = 2.29 × 10–3, x5 = 2.29 × 10–3)\\n\\n3.\\nx2\\n\\n—\\n0.150 – x\\n\\n= 0.0360\\n(x1 = 7.35 × 10–2, x2 = 5.25 × 10–2, x3 = 5.92 × 10–2, \\nx4 = 5.72 × 10–2, x5 = 5.78 × 10–2, x6 = 5.76 × 10–2, \\nx7 = 5.77 × 10–2, x8 = 5.77 × 10–2)\\n\\nEven in this last case, which requires eight iterations, the method of successive \\napproximations is easier than using the quadratic formula.\\n\\n\\n\\nA MAthEMAtIcAl REvIEw A-11\\n\\nA6. Plotting Data\\nThe human eye and brain are quite sensitive to recognizing straight lines, so it \\nis always desirable to plot equations or experimental data such that a straight \\nline is obtained. The mathematical equation for a straight line is of the form\\n\\n y  = mx  + b (A6.1)\\n\\nIn this equation, m  and b  are constants: m  is the slope of the line and b is its \\nintercept with the y axis. The slope of a straight line is a measure of its steep-\\nness; it is defined as the ratio of any vertical height to its corresponding horizon-\\ntal distance (sometimes called rise over run).\\n\\nLet’s plot the straight line\\n\\ny  = 2x  – 2\\n\\nWe first make a table of values of x and y:\\n\\nx –3 –2 –1 0 1 2 3 4 5\\n\\ny –8 –6 –4 –2 0 2 4 6 8\\n\\nThe result is plotted in Figure A.3. The line intersects the y axis at y  = –2 and so \\nb  = –2. The line has a slope (rise over run) of 2 and so m  = 2.\\n\\nOften the equation to be plotted will not appear to be of the form of \\nEquation A6.1 at first. For example, consider the Boyle’s law (Chapter 13) \\nrelation between the volume of a gas and its pressure.

There are several subsystems of units in the metric \\nsystem; and in an international effort to achieve uniformity, the International \\nSystem of Units (abbreviated SI from the French Système\\u2009International\\u2009d’Unités)\\u2009\\nwas adopted by the General Conference of Weights and Measures in 1960 as the\\u2009\\nrecommended units for science and technology. The SI system of units is con-\\nstructed from a set of basic units. The six units that are used frequently in gen-\\neral chemistry are given in Table B.1. Each has a technical definition that serves \\nto define the unit in an unambiguous, reproducible way. Here we give both the \\ntechnical definition and the relation between the corresponding English sys-\\ntem of measures for some SI units commonly used in chemistry:\\n\\n 1.  Length: In 1983, one meter was redefined as the distance that light trav-\\nels through space in 1/299 792 458 seconds. One meter is equivalent to \\n1.0936 yards, or to 39.370 inches. Thus, a meter stick is about 3 inches \\nlonger than a yardstick.\\n\\n 2.  Mass: The kilogram is the only SI unit still based on an artifact (Figure B.1). \\nAlthough a variety of definitions for the kilogram that are not based on \\nartifacts have been proposed, none has yet to be formally adopted. One \\nkilogram is equivalent to 2.2046 pounds. The mass of a substance is deter-\\nmined by balancing it against a set of standard masses using a balance.\\n\\n 3.  Temperature: The kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is the frac-\\ntion 1/273.15 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of \\nwater. On the Celsius scale, the freezing point of water at 760 Torr is 0°C \\n\\ntAblE b.1 Some basic SI units\\n\\nPhysical quantity Name of unit Symbol\\n\\nlength\\n\\nmass\\n\\ntime\\n\\ntemperature\\n\\namount of substance\\n\\nelectric current\\n\\nmeter\\n\\nkilogram\\n\\nsecond\\n\\nkelvin\\n\\nmole\\n\\nampere\\n\\nm\\n\\nkg\\n\\ns\\n\\nK\\n\\nmol\\n\\nA\\n\\n \\n\\nFigure b.1 The U.S. National \\nPrototype Kilogram is currently the \\nprimary standard for measuring mass \\nin the United States.

The Kelvin and Celsius scales \\nare related by the equation (Chapter 1)\\n\\n T ⁄ K = t ⁄ °C + 273.15 (B.1)\\n\\n   Recall that the freezing point of water is 32°F and its boiling point (at sea \\nlevel) is 212°F on the Fahrenheit scale. The relation between the Celsius \\nand Fahrenheit scales is given by\\n\\n\\u2009 t ⁄ °C  = 5–9(t ⁄ °F – 32) (B.2)\\n\\n   Thus, for example, 50°F corresponds to 10°C and 86°F corresponds to \\n30°C. Note that the symbol for kelvin is K and not °K.\\n\\n 4.  Amount of substance: One mole is the amount of substance that con-\\ntains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in exactly 0.012 kg of \\ncarbon-12 (Chapter 11).\\n\\nAn important feature of the SI system of units is the use of prefixes to desig-\\nnate multiples of the basic units (Table B.2).\\n\\nThe units of all quantities not listed in Table B.1 involve combinations of the \\nbasic SI units and are called derived units.

For example, the SI unit of force is a \\nnewton (N) that is defined as the force required to give a 1-kg body an acceleration \\nof 1 m·s–2. The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa). Pressure is force per area, \\nand a pascal is defined as the pressure produced by a force of 1 N acting on an \\narea of 1 m2. The SI unit of energy is the joule ( J). A joule is the energy that a \\nmass gains when it is acted upon by a force of 1 N through a distance of 1 m. \\nThus, we have J = N·m, or J = kg·m2·s–2.\\n\\nAlthough the SI is gradually becoming the universally accepted system of \\nunits, a number of older units are frequently used (Table B.4).
