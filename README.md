# alchemist
ML chemistry solver, borrowing solver capabilities from [chempy](https://github.com/bjodah/chempy).

The ultimate goal of `alchemist` is to:
- successfully classify undergraduate-level chemistry problems
- apply the proper algorithms to solve the problem
- display step-by-step instructions on how the problem was solved
- suggest, or even auto-generate, additional practice problems of similar scope and difficulty

Phase 1 of this project will focus on identifying problems that ask to balance a chemical equation. Depending on the difficulty of the task, this may expand to include any problem that requires the use of a balanced chemical equation to answer the question.
